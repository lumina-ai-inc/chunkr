## (Super) Quick Start

1. Go to [chunkr.ai](https://www.chunkr.ai) 
2. Make an account and copy your API key
3. Create a task:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/task \
      -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
      -H "Authorization: ${YOUR_API_KEY}" \
      -F "file=@/path/to/your/file" \
      -F "model=HighQuality" \
      -F "target_chunk_length=512" \
      -F "ocr_strategy=Auto"
   ```
4. Poll your created task:
    ```bash
   curl -X GET https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/task/${TASK_ID} \
      -H "Authorization: ${YOUR_API_KEY}"
   ```

## Self-Hosted Deployment Options

### Quick Start with Docker Compose
1. Prerequisites:
   - [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
   - [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) (for GPU support)

2. Deploy:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/luminainc/chunkr
   cd chunkr
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the services:
   - Web UI: `http://localhost:5173`
   - API: `http://localhost:8000`

> **Note**: Requires an NVIDIA CUDA GPU to run.

### Production Deployment with Kubernetes
For production environments, we provide Kubernetes manifests and deployment instructions:
1. See our detailed guide at [`self-deployment.md`](self-deployment.md)
2. Includes configurations for high availability and scaling

We're Lumina. We've built a search engine that's five times more relevant than Google Scholar. You can check us out at [lumina.sh](https://www.lumina.sh). We achieved this by bringing state-of-the-art search technology (the best in dense and sparse vector embeddings) to academic research. 

While search is one problem, sourcing high-quality data is another. We needed to process millions of PDFs in-house to build Lumina, and we found that existing solutions to extract structured information from PDFs were too slow and too expensive ($$ per page). 

Chunkr provides a self-hostable solution that leverages state-of-the-art (SOTA) vision models for segment extraction and OCR, unifying the output through a Rust Actix server. This setup allows you to process PDFs and extract segments at an impressive speed of approximately 5 pages per second on a single NVIDIA L4 instance, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for high-accuracy bounding box segment extraction and OCR. This solution has models that accommodate both GPU and CPU environments. Try the UI on [chunkr.ai](https://www.chunkr.ai)!
