For example, Netflix, a popular on-demand media streaming service, reported that they are collecting 0.6 TB of CSV-like log data in a DFS per day [11]. Each hour, the last hour’s structured log data is loaded to a 50+ node Hadoop/Hive-based data warehouse, which is used for the extraction of performance indicators and for ad-hoc queries. Our vision is to use Instant Loading in a single-node main memory database for these kinds of recurring load-work- unload workflows.

Back then, scientists complained that loading structured text data to a database doesn’t seem worth it and that once it is loaded, it can no longer be manip- ulated using standard application programs. Recent works addressed these objections [12, 3, 16]. NoDB [3] describes systems that “do not require data loading while still main- taining the whole feature set of a modern database system”. NoDB directly works on files and populates positional maps, i.e., index structures on files, and caches as a by-product of query processing. Even though the NoDB reference imple- mentation PostgresRaw has shown that queries can be pro- cessed without loading and query processing profits from the positional maps and caches, major issues are not solved. These, in our opinion, mainly include the efficient support of transactions, the scalability and efficiency of query process- ing, and the adaptability of the paradigm for main memory databases. Instant Loading is a different and novel approach that does not face these issues: Instead of eliminating data loading and adding the overhead of an additional layer of indirection, our approach focusses on making loading and unloading as unobtrusive as possible.",
