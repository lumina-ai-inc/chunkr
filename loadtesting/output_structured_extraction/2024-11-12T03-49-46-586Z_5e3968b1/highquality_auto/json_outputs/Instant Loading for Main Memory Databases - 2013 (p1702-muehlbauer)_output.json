For example, Netflix, a popular on-demand media streaming service, reported that they are collecting 0.6 TB of CSV-like log data in a DFS per day [11]. Each hour, the last hour’s structured log data is loaded to a 50+ node Hadoop/Hive-based data warehouse, which is used for the extraction of performance indicators and for ad-hoc queries. Our vision is to use Instant Loading in a single-node main memory database for these kinds of recurring load-work- unload workflows.

            "content": "The interface of Instant Loading in HyPer is designed in the style of the PostgreSQL COPY operator. Instant Loading takes CSV input, the schema it adheres to, and the CSV special characters as input. Except for \" \\ r \\ n\" , which we allow to be used as a record delimiter, we assume that spe- cial characters are single ASCII characters. For each rela- tion that is created or altered, we generate LLVM glue code functions for the processing of CSV chunks and for partition buffer merging (cf., the two steps in Fig. 4). Code genera- tion and compilation of these functions at runtime has the advantage that the resulting code has good locality and pre- dictable branching as the relation layout, e.g., the number of attributes and the attribute types, are known. Searching for delimiters and the deserialization methods are imple- mented as generic C++ functions that are not tailored to the design of HyPer. Just like the LLVM functions HyPer compiles for transactions and queries [22], the Instant Load- ing LLVM glue code calls these statically compiled C++ functions. Such LLVM glue code functions can further be created for other CSV-like formats using the C++ functions similar to a library. Code generation of the LLVM functions for CSV data is implemented for the four storage backend types in HyPer (cf. Sect. 2).",

            "markdown": "We first evaluated our task- and data-parallelized parsing and deserialization methods in isolation from the rest of the loading process. CSV data was read from ramfs , parsed, deserialized, and stored in heap-allocated result buffers. We implemented a variant that is SSE 4.2 optimized (SSE) as described in Sect. 3.4 and one that is not (non-SSE). As a contestant for these methods we used a parsing and dese- rialization implementation based on the Boost Spirit C++ library v2.5.2. In particular, we used Boost Spirit.Qi, which allows the generation of a recursive descent parser for a given grammar. We also experimented with an implementation based on Boost.Tokenizer and Boost.Lexical Cast but its performance trailed that of the Boost Spirit.Qi variant. Just like our SSE and non-SSE variants, we task-parallelized our Boost implementation as described in Sect. 3.3.\n\n"

The performance of ART heavily depends on the size of the effectively usable CPU cache per index [20]. In absolute numbers, however, ART achieves an index creation speed of 130M keys per sec- ond compared to 27M keys per second with HT. While the performance of HT does not depend on the distribution of keys, an ordered dense key range is the best case for ART. For unordered dense, i.e., randomly permuted dense keys, and sparse keys, i.e., randomly generated keys for which each bit is 1 or 0 with equal probability, the performance of ART drops. The index creation speed is still slightly better than with HT. For unordered key ranges merging is more costly than for ordered key ranges because mostly leaf nodes need to be merged.
