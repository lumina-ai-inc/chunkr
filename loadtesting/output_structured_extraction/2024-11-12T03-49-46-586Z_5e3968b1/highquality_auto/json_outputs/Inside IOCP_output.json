Having either too few or too many server threads to process client requests can lead to performance problems. For example, if a server creates a single thread to handle all requests clients can become starved since the server will be tied up processing one request at a time. Of course, a single thread could simultaneously process multiple requests, switching from one to another as I/O operations are started, but this architecture introduces significant complexity and cannot take advantage of multiprocessor systems. At the other extreme a server could create a big pool of threads so that virtually every client request is processed by a dedicated thread. This scenario usually leads to thread-thrashing, where lots of threads wake-up, perform some CPU processing, block waiting for I/O and then after request procesing is completed block again waiting for a new request.
