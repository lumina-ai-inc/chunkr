All rights reserved.\r\n1 Introduction\r\nThe Microsoft® Windows® family of operating systems provides a variety of\r\nmechanisms that drivers can use for synchronization. Synchronization is required \r\nfor:\r\n Any shared data that multiple threads might access, unless all threads access it \r\nin a read-only manner.\r\n A set of operations that must be performed atomically.\r\nTo understand why synchronization is important, consider a situation in which two \r\nthreads attempt to add one to the same global variable. This operation might \r\nrequire three processor instructions:\r\n1. Read MyVar into a register.\r\n2. Add 1 to the value in the register.\r\n3. Write the value of the register into MyVar.\r\nIf the two threads run simultaneously on a multiprocessor system with no locks or \r\nother synchronization, the results of an update could be lost. For example, assume \r\nthat the initial value of MyVar is 0 and that the operations proceed in the order\r\nshown below.\r\nThreads Using No Locks on a Multiprocessor System\r\nThread A on Processor 1 Thread B on Processor 2\r\nRead MyVar into register on \r\nProcessor 1.\r\nRead MyVar into register on \r\nProcessor 2.\r\nAdd 1 to Processor 2 register.\r\nWrite Processor 2 register into \r\nMyVar.\r\nAdd 1 to Processor 1 register.\r\nWrite Processor 1 register into \r\nMyVar.\r\nAfter both threads have updated MyVar, its value should be 2. However, the \r\nThread B update is lost when Thread A increments the original value of MyVar and \r\nthen overwrites the variable. Problems like this are often called race conditions.\r\nOn a single-processor system, thread pre-emption can also cause race conditions. \r\nAt any time, the operating system may temporarily stop running a thread and \r\ninstead run a different, higher-priority thread. When the system pre-empts a thread, \r\nthe operating system saves the values of the processor’s registers in the thread and\r\nrestores them when the thread runs again.",

As in the previous example, assume that the initial value of MyVar is 0.\r\nThreads Using No Locks on a Single Processor System\r\nThread A Thread B\r\nRead MyVar into register.\r\nPre-empt Thread A; run Thread B.\r\nRead MyVar into register.\r\nAdd 1 to register.\r\nWrite register into MyVar.\r\nPre-empt Thread B; run Thread A.\r\nAdd 1 to register.\r\nWrite register into MyVar.\r\nAs in the multiprocessor example, the resulting value in MyVar is 1 instead of 2.\r\nIn both examples, using a lock to synchronize access to the variable would prevent\r\nthe race condition. The lock ensures that Thread A has finished its update before \r\nThread B accesses the variable, as shown in the following example.\r\nThreads Using a Lock on Any System\r\nThread A Thread B\r\nAcquire lock.\r\nRead MyVar into register.\r\nAdd 1 to register.\r\nWrite register into MyVar.\r\nRelease lock. Acquire lock.\r\nRead MyVar into register.\r\nAdd 1 to register.\r\nWrite register into MyVar.\r\nRelease lock.\r\nThe lock ensures that one thread’s read and write operations are complete before \r\nanother thread can access the variable. With locks in place, the final value of MyVar \r\nafter these two code sequences complete is 2, which is the correct, intended result \r\nof the operation.\r\n2 Choosing a Synchronization Mechanism\r\nThe best way to synchronize access in any particular situation depends on the \r\noperations that require synchronization. Synchronization methods fall into several \r\nbroad categories. Within each category, Windows provides one or more specific \r\nmechanisms that drivers can use. Table 1 is a list of common synchronization\r\nmethods.\r\nTable 1.

Windows provides \r\ninterlocked routines to perform arithmetic and logical operations and to manipulate \r\nlists.\r\n2.1.2 Mutexes\r\nA mutex ensures mutually exclusive access; that is, while one thread has the \r\nmutex, all other threads are excluded from using it. A thread acquires the mutex \r\nbefore accessing the protected data and releases the mutex when access is \r\ncomplete. If the mutex is acquired, other threads must either spin or wait until it is \r\nreleased before they can acquire it.\r\nAny lock that grants mutually exclusive access can be considered a mutex. For \r\nexample, spin locks and synchronization events are both mutexes because only \r\none thread can acquire a spin lock at a time and only one thread becomes eligible \r\nfor execution when a synchronization event is signaled, The type of mutex that is \r\nappropriate for any particular situation depends on where and how the mutex will be \r\nused. When you are selecting a mutex, consider the following:\r\n At what IRQLs can the mutex be acquired and released?\r\n Does acquiring the mutex raise the current IRQL? If so, where is the old IRQL \r\nstored?\r\n Must the mutex be released on the same thread that acquired it?\r\n Can the mutex be acquired recursively? (That is, can a thread acquire the same \r\nmutex more than once without releasing it?)\r\n What happens to a mutex if the thread that is holding it is terminated? (This \r\nissue applies primarily to the mutexes that are used in user-mode applications.)",

Counted semaphores are useful for \r\nprotecting a set of identical data structures that are shared among several threads.\r\nIn Windows, the semaphore (a kernel dispatcher object) is a counted semaphore.\r\n3 Windows Synchronization Mechanisms\r\nWindows provides a variety of synchronization mechanisms, many of which are \r\nsubject to IRQL restrictions.

They are usually \r\nimplemented inline by the compiler and can be called at any IRQL.\r\n5 Spin Locks\r\nA spin lock does exactly what its name implies: while one thread owns a spin lock, \r\nany other threads that are waiting to acquire the lock “spin” on a memory location in \r\na busy wait until the lock is available. The threads do not block—that is, they are not \r\nsuspended or paged out; they retain control of the CPU, thus preventing execution \r\nof other code at the same or a lower IRQL.\r\nSpin locks are opaque objects of type KSPIN_LOCK. They must be allocated from \r\nnonpaged memory, such as the device extension of a driver-created device object \r\nor nonpaged pool allocated by the caller. Windows defines several types of spin \r\nlocks, as described in Table 4.\r\nTable 4. Windows Spin Locks\r\nType of spin lock Description\r\nOrdinary spin lock Protects shared data at DISPATCH_LEVEL or higher. \r\nUsed with ExInterlockedXxx routines and elsewhere \r\nthroughout drivers. (Drivers for Windows XP or later \r\nversions of Windows should use queued spin locks \r\ninstead of ordinary spin locks.)\r\nQueued spin lock Protects shared data at DISPATCH_LEVEL or higher. \r\nUsed with ExInterlockedXxx routines and elsewhere \r\nthroughout drivers. Queued spin locks are supported on \r\nWindows XP and later versions of Windows.\r\nInterrupt spin lock Protects shared data at DIRQL. Used in \r\nInterruptService and SynchCritSection routines.\r\nAll types of spin locks raise the IRQL to DISPATCH_LEVEL or higher. Spin locks \r\nare the only synchronization mechanism that can be used at IRQL >= \r\nDISPATCH_LEVEL. Code that holds a spin lock runs at IRQL >= \r\nDISPATCH_LEVEL, which means that the system’s thread switching code (the \r\ndispatcher) cannot run and, therefore, the current thread cannot be pre-empted. \r\nTherefore, drivers should hold spin locks for only the minimum required amount of \r\ntime and eliminate from the locked code path any tasks that do not require locking. \r\nHolding a spin lock for an unnecessarily long duration can hurt performance \r\nsystem-wide.\r\nAll code within the spin lock must conform to the guidelines for running at IRQL >= \r\nDISPATCH_LEVEL. Every driver writer should understand these rules. For \r\nexample, code within the spin lock must not cause a page fault because at IRQL >= \r\nDISPATCH_LEVEL, the operating system cannot wait for the kernel dispatcher \r\nevent that is set internally when paging I/O completes. A page fault within a spin \r\nlock causes the system to crash with the bug check value \r\nIRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. Additional restrictions also apply. For complete \r\ninformation about these guidelines, see the companion white paper “Thread \r\nContext, Scheduling, and IRQL,” which is available at \r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hwdev/driver/IRQL.mspx.\r\nTo implement spin locks on a single-processor system, the operating system has \r\nonly to raise the IRQL, which prevents pre-emption of the current thread. Because \r\nno other threads can run concurrently, raising the IRQL is adequate to protect any \r\nshared structures. (Note, however, that the checked build of the operating system \r\nuses spin locks, even on single-processor systems.) On an SMP system, the ",

All rights reserved.\r\noperating system raises the IRQL and then spins by testing and setting a variable \r\nusing an interlocked instruction.\r\n5.1 Ordinary Spin Locks\r\nOrdinary spin locks work at DISPATCH_LEVEL. To create an ordinary spin lock, a \r\ndriver allocates a KSPIN_LOCK structure in nonpaged memory and then calls \r\nKeInitializeSpinLock to initialize it. Code that runs at IRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL \r\nmust acquire and release the lock by calling KeAcquireSpinLock and \r\nKeReleaseSpinLock. These routines raise the IRQL before acquiring the lock and \r\nthen lower the IRQL upon release of the lock.\r\nCode that is already running at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL should call \r\nKeAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel and KeReleaseSpinLockFromDpcLevel\r\ninstead. These routines do not change the IRQL.\r\n5.2 Queued Spin Locks\r\nQueued spin locks are a more efficient variation of ordinary spin locks. Queued spin \r\nlocks are available in Windows XP and later releases of Windows. Whenever \r\nmultiple threads request the same queued spin lock, the waiting threads are queued \r\nin order of their request. In addition, queued spin locks test and set a variable that is \r\nlocal to the current CPU, so they generate less bus traffic and are more efficient on \r\nnon-uniform memory architectures (NUMA).\r\nA queued spin lock requires a KLOCK_QUEUE_HANDLE structure in addition to a \r\nKSPIN_LOCK structure. The KLOCK_QUEUE_HANDLE structure provides storage \r\nfor a handle to the queue and the associated lock. This structure can be allocated \r\non the stack. To initialize a queued spin lock, the driver calls KeInitializeSpinLock.\r\nTo ensure that the IRQL is properly raised and lowered, driver routines that run at \r\nPASSIVE_LEVEL or APC_LEVEL must call KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLock\r\nand KeReleaseInStackQueuedSpinLock to acquire and release these locks \r\nDriver routines that run at DISPATCH_LEVEL should call \r\nKeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLockAtDpcLevel and \r\nKeReleaseInStackQueuedSpinLockFromDpcLevel instead. These routines do \r\nnot raise and lower the IRQL.\r\n5.3 Interrupt Spin Locks\r\nAn interrupt spin lock protects data such as device registers that a driver’s \r\nInterruptService routine and SynchCritSection routine access at DIRQL. When a \r\ndevice driver connects its interrupt object, the operating system creates an interrupt \r\nspin lock associated with that interrupt object. The driver is not required to allocate \r\nstorage for the spin lock or to initialize it.\r\nWhen an interrupt occurs, the system raises the IRQL on the processor to DIRQL \r\nfor the interrupting device, acquires the default interrupt spin lock associated with \r\nthe interrupt object, and then calls the driver’s InterruptService routine. While the \r\nInterruptService routine is running, the processor IRQL remains at DIRQL and the \r\noperating system holds the corresponding interrupt spin lock. When the \r\nInterruptService routine exits, the operating system releases the lock and lowers the \r\nIRQL (unless another interrupt is pending at that level).\r\nThe system also acquires the default interrupt spin lock when a driver calls \r\nKeSynchronizeExecution to run a SynchCritSection routine. The operating system \r\nraises the IRQL to DIRQL for the device, acquires the lock, and invokes the \r\nSynchCritSection routine. When the routine exits, the operating system releases the \r\nlock and lowers the IRQL. Other driver routines that share data with the ",

All rights reserved.\r\nInterruptService routine or SynchCritSection routine must call \r\nKeAcquireInterruptSpinLock to acquire this lock before they can access the \r\nshared data. KeAcquireInterruptSpinLock is available on Windows XP and later \r\nreleases of Windows.\r\nSome types of devices can generate multiple interrupts at different levels. Examples \r\ninclude devices that support PCI 3.0 MSI-X, which generate message-signaled \r\ninterrupts (MSI), and a few older devices that interrupt at more than one IRQL. \r\nDrivers that support such devices must serialize access to data among two or more \r\nInterruptService routines.\r\nIn this case, the driver must create a spin lock to protect shared data at the highest \r\nDIRQL at which any interrupt may arrive. When the driver connects its interrupt \r\nobjects, it passes a pointer to the driver-allocated KSPIN_LOCK structure, along \r\nwith the highest DIRQL at which the device interrupts. The operating system \r\nassociates the driver-created spin lock and the DIRQL with the interrupt object.\r\nWhen the operating system calls the InterruptService routines, it raises the IRQL to \r\nthe DIRQL specified with the interrupt object and acquires the driver-created spin \r\nlock. The system also uses this lock when it runs a SynchCritSection routine. Other \r\ndriver routines that share data with the InterruptService or SynchCritSection routine \r\nmust call KeAcquireInterruptSpinLock to acquire this lock before they can access \r\nthe shared data.\r\nNote\r\nThe next version of Windows, Microsoft Vista™ includes significant changes to the \r\ninterrupt architecture to support message-signaled interrupts. Specifically, the \r\nIoConnectInterrupt routine is deprecated. You should use its replacement, \r\nIoConnectInterruptEx in new drivers, and older versions of drivers should be \r\nupdated to use this new routine if possible. The Windows DDL provides this routine \r\nfor use in Windows 2000 and later releases of Windows. For more information \r\nabout these upcoming changes, see the white paper “Interrupt Architecture \r\nEnhancements in Microsoft Windows Vista,” which is available at \r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hwdev/bus/pci/MSI.mspx.\r\n6 ExInterlockedXxx Routines\r\nThe ExInterlockedXxx routines perform arithmetic and list manipulation operations. \r\nAll of these routines (except for ExInterlockedAddLargeStatistic) use a driver\u0002allocated spin lock.\r\nThe ExInterlockedXxx routines are coded in assembly language and usually\r\ndisable interrupts at the processor; in effect, they run at IRQL = HIGH_LEVEL. To \r\nprotect data on SMP systems, the operating system raises the IRQL and acquires \r\nthe spin lock before performing the operation. When the routine completes, the \r\noperating system releases the lock and returns the IRQL to its original value. Like \r\nother routines that run at IRQL>= DISPATCH_LEVEL, ExInterlockedXxx routines \r\ncan operate only on data in nonpaged memory. Therefore, any parameter passed \r\nto one of these routines must be allocated on the kernel stack, from nonpaged pool, \r\nor in the device extension of the device object.\r\nUse the ExInterlockedXxx routines to perform arithmetic operations on a shared \r\nvariable that a driver also accesses elsewhere, perhaps as part of a larger structure \r\nor in a longer sequence of tasks. For example, assume that a driver maintains a \r\nstructure that contains status information about its device. The driver’s DpcForIsr\r\nroutine accesses this structure, as do several routines that run at IRQL = \r\nPASSIVE_LEVEL. Therefore, the driver must protect the structure with a spin lock. ",

All rights reserved.\r\nInterruptService routine or SynchCritSection routine must call \r\nKeAcquireInterruptSpinLock to acquire this lock before they can access the \r\nshared data. KeAcquireInterruptSpinLock is available on Windows XP and later \r\nreleases of Windows.\r\nSome types of devices can generate multiple interrupts at different levels. Examples \r\ninclude devices that support PCI 3.0 MSI-X, which generate message-signaled \r\ninterrupts (MSI), and a few older devices that interrupt at more than one IRQL. \r\nDrivers that support such devices must serialize access to data among two or more \r\nInterruptService routines.\r\nIn this case, the driver must create a spin lock to protect shared data at the highest \r\nDIRQL at which any interrupt may arrive. When the driver connects its interrupt \r\nobjects, it passes a pointer to the driver-allocated KSPIN_LOCK structure, along \r\nwith the highest DIRQL at which the device interrupts. The operating system \r\nassociates the driver-created spin lock and the DIRQL with the interrupt object.\r\nWhen the operating system calls the InterruptService routines, it raises the IRQL to \r\nthe DIRQL specified with the interrupt object and acquires the driver-created spin \r\nlock. The system also uses this lock when it runs a SynchCritSection routine. Other \r\ndriver routines that share data with the InterruptService or SynchCritSection routine \r\nmust call KeAcquireInterruptSpinLock to acquire this lock before they can access \r\nthe shared data.\r\nNote\r\nThe next version of Windows, Microsoft Vista™ includes significant changes to the \r\ninterrupt architecture to support message-signaled interrupts. Specifically, the \r\nIoConnectInterrupt routine is deprecated. You should use its replacement, \r\nIoConnectInterruptEx in new drivers, and older versions of drivers should be \r\nupdated to use this new routine if possible. The Windows DDL provides this routine \r\nfor use in Windows 2000 and later releases of Windows. For more information \r\nabout these upcoming changes, see the white paper “Interrupt Architecture \r\nEnhancements in Microsoft Windows Vista,” which is available at \r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/whdc/hwdev/bus/pci/MSI.mspx.\r\n6 ExInterlockedXxx Routines\r\nThe ExInterlockedXxx routines perform arithmetic and list manipulation operations. \r\nAll of these routines (except for ExInterlockedAddLargeStatistic) use a driver\u0002allocated spin lock.\r\nThe ExInterlockedXxx routines are coded in assembly language and usually\r\ndisable interrupts at the processor; in effect, they run at IRQL = HIGH_LEVEL. To \r\nprotect data on SMP systems, the operating system raises the IRQL and acquires \r\nthe spin lock before performing the operation. When the routine completes, the \r\noperating system releases the lock and returns the IRQL to its original value. Like \r\nother routines that run at IRQL>= DISPATCH_LEVEL, ExInterlockedXxx routines \r\ncan operate only on data in nonpaged memory. Therefore, any parameter passed \r\nto one of these routines must be allocated on the kernel stack, from nonpaged pool, \r\nor in the device extension of the device object.\r\nUse the ExInterlockedXxx routines to perform arithmetic operations on a shared \r\nvariable that a driver also accesses elsewhere, perhaps as part of a larger structure \r\nor in a longer sequence of tasks. For example, assume that a driver maintains a \r\nstructure that contains status information about its device. The driver’s DpcForIsr\r\nroutine accesses this structure, as do several routines that run at IRQL = \r\nPASSIVE_LEVEL. Therefore, the driver must protect the structure with a spin lock. ",

An S-list is a sequenced, \r\ninterlocked, singly linked list that is both thread-safe and multiprocessor safe. Every \r\nS-list has an associated spin lock and a sequence number. The spin lock is used to \r\nprotect the list while entries are inserted or deleted. The sequence number is \r\nincremented each time an entry is inserted or deleted. On some hardware \r\narchitectures, using a sequence number enables these routines to avoid using a \r\nspin lock.\r\nA driver must be running at IRQL <= DISPATCH_LEVEL to call the S-list routines. \r\nS-lists are useful for maintaining caches because a driver can simply and quickly \r\nremove the most recently used item from the list. Internally, Windows uses S-lists to \r\nimplement lookaside lists.\r\n7 Fast Mutexes\r\nFast mutexes, also called executive mutexes, enable a driver to protect a region for \r\nexclusive access. While a thread holds a fast mutex, no other thread can acquire \r\nthe mutex. A fast mutex is an opaque structure of type FAST_MUTEX, which must \r\nbe allocated from nonpaged memory.\r\nFast mutexes have low overhead and do not require the use of the system-wide \r\ndispatcher lock. As their name implies, fast mutexes are faster and more efficient \r\nthan kernel mutexes.\r\nCode paths that are protected by a fast mutex run at IRQL=APC_LEVEL, thus \r\ndisabling delivery of all APCs and preventing the thread from suspension.

Blocks until the \r\nmutex is available.\r\nExTryToAcquireFastMutex Raises the IRQL to APC_LEVEL before acquiring the fast \r\nmutex. Does not block if the mutex is not available.\r\nExAcquireFastMutex and ExAcquireFastMutexUnsafe cause the thread to block \r\nuntil the mutex is available. ExTryToAcquireFastMutex returns FALSE \r\nimmediately if another thread has already acquired the mutex. Both \r\nExAcquireFastMutex and ExTryToAcquireFastMutex raise the IRQL to \r\nAPC_LEVEL before acquiring the fast mutex. Drivers should use \r\nExAcquireFastMutexUnsafe (which does not raise the IRQL) only if either of the \r\nfollowing is true:\r\n The thread is already running at APC_LEVEL.\r\n The thread acquires the mutex within a critical region that was previously \r\nentered by a call to KeEnterCriticalRegion or FsRtlEnterFileSystem.\r\nIn either of these situations, user-mode and normal kernel-mode APC delivery has \r\nalready been disabled for the thread.\r\nTo use a fast mutex, a driver must:\r\n1. Allocate a structure of type FAST_MUTEX from nonpaged pool.\r\n2. Initialize the fast mutex by calling ExInitializeFastMutex.",

To manipulate any of these objects, the \r\nsystem must raise the IRQL to DISPATCH_LEVEL and acquire the system-wide \r\ndispatcher lock, which protects the dispatcher database. However, the dispatcher \r\nlock is used frequently by many components, so sometimes the system must wait \r\nfor it. Such waits can slow driver performance. For this reason, drivers should use \r\nexecutive resources or fast mutexes instead of kernel dispatcher objects whenever \r\npossible.\r\nKernel dispatcher objects are all based on the same common header \r\n(DISPATCHER_HEADER), but each type of object has its own object-type-specific \r\ninitialization and release routines. Kernel dispatcher objects must be allocated from \r\nnonpaged pool or in the device extension of the device object.\r\nA driver can refer to a kernel dispatcher object by using either a handle or a pointer. \r\nIf a driver uses a handle to refer to a kernel dispatcher object that it created in an \r\narbitrary thread context, that driver must set the OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE attribute \r\nfor the object. Setting this attribute protects system security by preventing user\u0002mode threads from accessing the handle.\r\nDrivers usually use kernel dispatcher objects to wait for the results of a \r\nsynchronous I/O operation. Highest-level drivers that create and send IRPs to \r\nlower-level drivers wait in the context of the thread that issued the I/O request.\r\nLower-level drivers sometimes must wait in an arbitrary thread context to \r\nsynchronize execution among driver routines that run at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL or \r\nAPC_LEVEL. For example, a driver might wait in its DispatchPnP routine for an \r\nevent that is set when certain device operations are complete. As a general rule, \r\nhowever, drivers should avoid blocking any thread other than the thread that \r\ninitiated the current I/O request.\r\nKernel dispatcher objects have two states: signaled and not signaled. Signaling \r\nindicates that the object is available for acquisition. Thus, an object in the signaled \r\nstate is not owned (acquired) by any thread. An object in the not-signaled state is \r\nowned by one or more threads. The type of object determines the state to which the \r\nobject is initially set. For example, kernel mutexes are set to the signaled state \r\nimmediately upon initialization, but events must be explicitly signaled by a call to the \r\nKeSetEvent routine.\r\nAlthough each type of object has its own type-specific initialization and release \r\nroutines, drivers use KeWaitForSingleObject and KeWaitForMultipleObjects to \r\nacquire any kernel dispatcher object. Using KeWaitForSingleObject, a driver can \r\nwait for a single kernel dispatcher object. Using KeWaitForMultipleObjects, a \r\ndriver can wait for more than one kernel dispatcher object; the objects need not be \r\nof the same type. Each of these routines takes as parameters:\r\n A pointer to the object(s) that are to be acquired.\r\n A reason for the wait. Drivers that are waiting on behalf of a user request in the \r\ncontext of a user thread should specify UserRequest; otherwise, drivers should \r\nspecify Executive. The value of this field is informational only.\r\n A Boolean value (Alertable) that indicates whether the thread should be \r\nalertable while it is waiting. For drivers, this is usually FALSE.\r\n A wait mode (WaitMode), either KernelMode or UserMode. For drivers, this is \r\nusually KernelMode. If one or more of the objects is a mutex, this value must\r\nbe KernelMode.",

Kernel dispatcher objects must be allocated from \r\nnonpaged pool or in the device extension of the device object.\r\nA driver can refer to a kernel dispatcher object by using either a handle or a pointer. \r\nIf a driver uses a handle to refer to a kernel dispatcher object that it created in an \r\narbitrary thread context, that driver must set the OBJ_KERNEL_HANDLE attribute \r\nfor the object. Setting this attribute protects system security by preventing user\u0002mode threads from accessing the handle.\r\nDrivers usually use kernel dispatcher objects to wait for the results of a \r\nsynchronous I/O operation. Highest-level drivers that create and send IRPs to \r\nlower-level drivers wait in the context of the thread that issued the I/O request.\r\nLower-level drivers sometimes must wait in an arbitrary thread context to \r\nsynchronize execution among driver routines that run at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL or \r\nAPC_LEVEL. For example, a driver might wait in its DispatchPnP routine for an \r\nevent that is set when certain device operations are complete. As a general rule, \r\nhowever, drivers should avoid blocking any thread other than the thread that \r\ninitiated the current I/O request.\r\nKernel dispatcher objects have two states: signaled and not signaled. Signaling \r\nindicates that the object is available for acquisition. Thus, an object in the signaled \r\nstate is not owned (acquired) by any thread. An object in the not-signaled state is \r\nowned by one or more threads. The type of object determines the state to which the \r\nobject is initially set. For example, kernel mutexes are set to the signaled state \r\nimmediately upon initialization, but events must be explicitly signaled by a call to the \r\nKeSetEvent routine.\r\nAlthough each type of object has its own type-specific initialization and release \r\nroutines, drivers use KeWaitForSingleObject and KeWaitForMultipleObjects to \r\nacquire any kernel dispatcher object. Using KeWaitForSingleObject, a driver can \r\nwait for a single kernel dispatcher object. Using KeWaitForMultipleObjects, a \r\ndriver can wait for more than one kernel dispatcher object; the objects need not be \r\nof the same type. Each of these routines takes as parameters:\r\n A pointer to the object(s) that are to be acquired.\r\n A reason for the wait. Drivers that are waiting on behalf of a user request in the \r\ncontext of a user thread should specify UserRequest; otherwise, drivers should \r\nspecify Executive. The value of this field is informational only.\r\n A Boolean value (Alertable) that indicates whether the thread should be \r\nalertable while it is waiting. For drivers, this is usually FALSE.\r\n A wait mode (WaitMode), either KernelMode or UserMode. For drivers, this is \r\nusually KernelMode. If one or more of the objects is a mutex, this value must\r\nbe KernelMode.",

This IRQL restriction \r\nmeans that a driver cannot wait for an event or other dispatcher object in an \r\nIoCompletion routine, in a StartIo routine, or in any deferred procedure call (DPC) \r\nroutine, because these routines can be called at DISPATCH_LEVEL. Highest-level \r\ndrivers that are called in the context of the user thread that made the I/O request \r\ncan wait for kernel dispatcher objects in their read and write dispatch routines. \r\nLower-level drivers should not wait in these routines; the read and write dispatch \r\nroutines of some lower-level drivers, particularly in the storage and USB stacks, can \r\nbe called at IRQL = DISPATCH_LEVEL.\r\nHowever, a thread can acquire a kernel dispatcher object at DISPATCH_LEVEL if it \r\ndoes not wait for the object. To acquire a kernel dispatcher object without waiting, a \r\nthread sets the time-out value to zero in its call to KeWaitForSingleObject or \r\nKeWaitForMultipleObjects. A time-out value equal to zero means that the driver \r\ndoes not wait for the object to be signaled; instead, the call returns immediately with \r\na status that indicates whether an object was available and acquired or is not \r\ncurrently available. Because no waiting is involved, such a call is valid at \r\nDISPATCH_LEVEL.\r\nThis feature is useful for testing whether an object has been signaled. For example, \r\na DPC routine that must perform a task in synchronization with some other routine \r\nmight check to see whether the object has been signaled. If so, the DPC can \r\nperform the task. If not, the DPC can do some other, unrelated task, or it can queue \r\na work item to perform the original task. Because the work item runs in a thread at \r\nIRQL=PASSIVE_LEVEL, the work item can wait for a nonzero period.\r\n8.1.2 Alerts and Wait Modes\r\nThe Alertable and WaitMode parameters to KeWaitForSingleObject and \r\nKeWaitForMultipleObjects determine how the system handles user-mode APCs \r\nwhile the thread is waiting.

User-mode APCs do not interrupt \r\nuser-mode code. After an application queues a user-mode APC to a thread, the \r\napplication can cause the system to deliver the APCs by calling a wait function with \r\nthe Alertable parameter set to TRUE. (The user-mode terminate APC is an \r\nexception. This APC is queued to terminate a thread, and the system delivers it \r\nwhenever the thread unwinds back to user mode from kernel mode, not only after \r\nan alertable wait.)\r\nIf a driver calls either KeWaitForSingleObject or KeWaitForMultipleObjects with \r\nthe Alertable parameter set to TRUE and the WaitMode parameter set to \r\nUserMode, the wait aborts with STATUS_USER_APC or STATUS_ALERTED \r\nwhenever a user-mode APC (or an alert) is pending. When the thread returns to \r\nuser mode, the system automatically delivers the user-mode APC.

However, the driver must \r\nbe waiting at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL and must not be in a critical region.\r\nThe wait mode also determines whether the thread’s kernel-mode stack can be \r\npaged out while waiting. If WaitMode is set to UserMode, the system pages out the \r\nkernel-mode stack while the thread is waiting. Waiting in UserMode is safe only if \r\nthe waiting driver is the only driver on the stack.

If that driver is running at IRQL=DISPATCH_LEVEL or higher, the \r\npage fault will cause the system to crash. Because PnP driver stacks often include \r\nfilter drivers, PnP drivers rarely set WaitMode to UserMode.\r\nNote\r\nFor more information about alertable waits, APCs, and the rules for operating at \r\nIRQL=DISPATCH_LEVEL, see the companion white paper “Scheduling, Thread \r\nContext, and IRQL” and the section “Do Waiting Threads Receive Alerts and APCs”\r\nunder “Kernel-Mode Driver Architecture” in the Windows DDK.",

All rights reserved.\r\n8.2 Events\r\nDrivers use events to synchronize activities between kernel-mode threads or \r\nbetween kernel-mode threads and user-mode applications. Both user-mode and \r\nkernel-mode code can create events. Windows also defines several standard event\r\nobjects in the \\\\KernelObject object directory. Drivers can wait on these standard \r\nevents.\r\nAn event is a synchronization object of type KEVENT, which must be allocated in \r\nnonpaged memory. Events can be either named or unnamed. Drivers usually use \r\nnamed events only to synchronize with external processes, such a user-mode \r\napplication or another driver. Internally, drivers use unnamed events. Windows \r\nsupports two types of events, notification events and synchronization events. The \r\ntwo types of event differ in the actions taken when they are signaled, as described \r\nlater under “Notification Events” and “Synchronization Events.”\r\nTo create and initialize an unnamed event of either type, a driver allocates an object \r\nof type KEVENT in nonpaged memory. The driver then calls KeInitializeEvent and \r\nspecifies the type of event as a parameter in the call. To create and initialize a \r\nnamed event, the driver calls IoCreateNotificationEvent or \r\nIoCreateSynchronizationEvent.\r\nTo wait for an event, a driver calls KeWaitForSingleObject or \r\nKeWaitForMultipleObjects, as described previously under “Kernel Dispatcher \r\nObjects.”\r\nTo signal an event, a driver calls KeSetEvent, which has three parameters: a \r\npointer to the event, a priority boost, and the Boolean Wait. Setting Wait to TRUE \r\nindicates that the thread intends to call KeWaitXxx immediately after KeSetEvent\r\nreturns. This parameter provides an optimization in the cases where the driver \r\nintends to wait for another kernel dispatcher object immediately.\r\nNormally, drivers call KeSetEvent with Wait set to FALSE. When Wait is FALSE,\r\nKeSetEvent raises the IRQL to DISPATCH_LEVEL, acquires the dispatcher lock, \r\nmodifies the signaled-state of the event object, satisfies any outstanding waits, \r\nunlocks the dispatcher database, lowers the IRQL to its original value, and returns.\r\nIf the Wait parameter is TRUE, however, KeSetEvent does not release the \r\ndispatcher lock or lower the IRQL. This optimization can prevent unnecessary \r\ncontext switches because the caller thus signals the event and waits in one atomic \r\noperation. If a driver uses this feature, it must call KeSetEvent from IRQL < \r\nDISPATCH_LEVEL and in a non-arbitrary thread context.\r\nA driver routine that operates in a producer/consumer scenario might use this \r\nfeature. Such a driver usually works with two events in the following way. The driver \r\nroutine that produces data signals the first event to indicate that it is ready to send \r\ndata. It then immediately waits for the second event to be signaled by another \r\nthread. The second thread sets the second event to indicate it has received the \r\ndata and is ready for more. Drivers should use this feature only in the context of the \r\nthread that requested the I/O operation; a driver should avoid blocking an unrelated \r\nthread.\r\n8.2.1 Notification Events\r\nA notification event wakes every waiting thread and remains in the signaled state \r\nuntil it is explicitly reset by a call to KeResetEvent. In the Win32® API, notification \r\nevents are called manual reset events.",

All rights reserved.\r\nDrivers typically use notification events to wait for the completion of IRPs that they \r\nallocate and send. For example, a driver might send an I/O control code (IOCTL) to \r\nlower drivers in its device stack by calling IoBuildDeviceIoControlRequest. One of \r\nthe parameters to this routine is a pointer to an event object. After the driver routine\r\ncreates and sends the IRP, it waits on the event object. When the IRP is complete, \r\nthe I/O Manager signals the event, thus satisfying the wait. The event remains \r\nsignaled until a call to KeResetEvent returns it to the non-signaled state.\r\n8.2.2 Synchronization Events\r\nSynchronization events, also called auto-resetting events, wake a single thread and \r\nimmediately return to the non-signaled state. Drivers use synchronization events \r\nless frequently than notification events.\r\nA driver for a device that requires a long time to initialize might wait on a \r\nsynchronization event in its StartDevice routine to ensure that its device is fully \r\ninitialized. The driver’s DpcForIsr routine signals the event after the device has \r\ninterrupted and any additional processing at IRQL DISPATCH_LEVEL is complete. \r\nControl then returns to the StartDevice routine, which can continue with device and \r\ndriver initialization. Similarly, a driver might wait on a synchronization event in its \r\nDispatchPnp routine to ensure that I/O has completed before stopping or removing \r\nthe device.\r\n8.2.3 Synchronizing with User-Mode Applications\r\nKernel-mode drivers cannot make calls to user-mode routines. However, a kernel\u0002mode driver with a closely-coupled application might sometimes need to notify the \r\napplication about a device- or driver-related occurrence. There are several ways to \r\nimplement such notification; two recommended methods are outlined in this section.\r\nOne way to coordinate activities between a kernel-mode driver and a user-mode \r\napplication is to share an event. In the driver:\r\n1. Define a private I/O control code (IOCTL) with which a user-mode application \r\ncan pass an event.\r\n2. Provide a DispatchDeviceControl routine that handles the private IOCTL \r\nsupplied in IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL requests.\r\n3. Validate the handle received in the IOCTL by calling \r\nObReferenceObjectByHandle. In the DesiredAccess parameter, specify \r\nSYNCHRONIZE access, and in the ObjectType parameter, specify \r\n*ExEventObjectType.\r\n6. To signal the event, call KeSetEvent; to reset a notification event, call \r\nKeResetEvent.\r\n7. Call ObDereferenceObject to free the handle when the event is no longer \r\nneeded.\r\nIn the user-mode application:\r\n1. Create a named event by calling CreateEvent.\r\n2. Pass the handle to the event to the driver by calling DeviceIoControl, \r\nspecifying the driver-defined IOCTL.\r\n3. To wait for the kernel-mode driver to signal the event, call \r\nWaitForSingleObject or WaitForMultipleObjects.\r\n4. Delete the event object before exiting by calling CloseHandle.",

All rights reserved.\r\nThis technique is suitable in situations where the driver routine and the user-mode \r\nthread that share the event always run in the same process context. However, in \r\nthe layered WDM driver model, lower-level driver routines are not usually called in \r\nthe context of the requesting thread or process.\r\nA more general approach that eliminates thread context problems is to use a\r\nDeviceIoControl request without an event. In this technique, the driver defines a \r\nprivate IOCTL for the I/O request. The application creates a dedicated thread that \r\nsends the DeviceIoControl request to the driver, which returns \r\nSTATUS_PENDING. To notify the user-mode application, the driver completes the \r\nrequest. Because this technique does not depend upon the validity of user-mode \r\ndata, it is suitable for use in lower-level drivers.\r\nFor an example of both of these techniques, see the event sample \r\n(src\\general\\event) in the Windows DDK.\r\n8.3 Kernel Mutexes\r\nKernel mutexes, often just called mutexes, are useful for synchronizing access to \r\nmemory in pageable code or over a relatively long period of time. A kernel mutex \r\nensures that a thread has exclusive access to the protected data. Drivers can use \r\nkernel mutexes at IRQL <= APC_LEVEL.\r\nKernel mutexes depend on thread context. Driver routines that use kernel mutexes \r\nare usually highest-level driver routines that run in the context of the thread that \r\nrequested the I/O operation. A driver routine that acquires a mutex should release it \r\nwithin the same thread context.\r\nKernel mutexes differ from fast mutexes in the following ways:\r\n Kernel mutexes can be acquired recursively; fast mutexes cannot.\r\n Kernel mutexes are acquired by using KeWaitForSingleObject, \r\nKeWaitForMultipleObjects, and KeWaitForMutexObject. Fast mutexes are \r\nacquired by using ExAcquireFastMutex, ExTryToAcquireFastMutex, and \r\nExAcquireFastMutexUnsafe.\r\n Kernel mutexes require the use of the system-wide dispatcher lock. Therefore, \r\nthey have greater overhead and are less efficient than fast mutexes.\r\nTo use a kernel mutex, a driver must:\r\n1. Allocate a KMUTEX data structure in nonpaged memory such as the device \r\nextension of a driver-created device object or nonpaged pool.\r\n2. Initialize the mutex by calling KeInitializeMutex, passing a pointer to the \r\npreviously allocated data structure. (The Level parameter is ignored.)\r\n3. Wait for the mutex by calling KeWaitForSingleObject, \r\nKeWaitForMultipleObjects, or KeWaitForMutexObject.\r\n4. Perform the required operations on the protected data.\r\n5. Release the mutex by calling KeReleaseMutex.\r\nThe operating system initializes every kernel mutex to the signaled state. \r\nConsequently, the first thread’s initial call to wait for the mutex succeeds \r\nimmediately and returns.\r\nDriver routines should always specify KernelMode when they are waiting for a \r\nkernel mutex. Waiting in kernel mode prevents the thread’s kernel-mode stack from \r\nbeing paged out and disables the delivery of user-mode and normal kernel-mode \r\nAPCs, thus preventing thread termination and suspension.

Initialize the semaphore by calling KeInitializeSemaphore, specifying the \r\nsemaphore’s count and limit. Setting the count to 0 initializes the semaphore in \r\nthe not-signaled state; setting the count greater than 0 signals the semaphore \r\nand indicates how many threads can acquire it initially.\r\n3. Wait for the semaphore by calling KeWaitForSingleObject or \r\nKeWaitForMultipleObjects.\r\n4. Perform the required operations on the protected data.\r\n5. Release the semaphore by calling KeReleaseSemaphore, passing a value to \r\nadd to the current count.\r\nIf a driver increases the count of a semaphore above the semaphore’s limit, the \r\nsystem raises an exception.

This behavior is different from that of \r\nevents; setting an already signaled event has no effect.\r\nWhen a thread releases a semaphore, it can also specify a Wait parameter.

On a checked build, the system ASSERTs if the \r\nrequesting thread does not own exclusive access to the resource.\r\nOne thread can release a resource on behalf of another by calling the routine \r\nExReleaseResourceForThread. File system drivers use this routine when one \r\nthread acquires a resource, partially processes an I/O request, and then posts the \r\nI/O request to another thread. In this case, the thread that completes the I/O \r\nrequest can call this routine to release the resource on behalf of the first thread.\r\nA driver can determine whether a resource has already been acquired by any \r\nthread using the utility routines ExIsResourceAcquiredLite, \r\nExIsResourceAcquiredSharedLite, and ExIsResourceAcquiredExclusiveLite. \r\nIn addition, a driver can determine how many other threads are waiting for either \r\nshared or exclusive access to a resource by calling ExGetSharedWaiterCount or \r\nExGetExclusiveWaiterCount.\r\nSuspending a thread that owns an executive resource can cause a deadlock. For \r\nexample, assume that Thread 1 has shared access to a resource and that Thread 2 \r\nis waiting for exclusive access to the same resource. If Thread 1 is suspended, \r\nThread 2 could wait forever for the resource. A malicious user could intentionally \r\ncreate a deadlock in this manner to mount a denial-of-service attack on the driver \r\nand, perhaps, on the entire operating system. For this reason, drivers must prevent \r\nthread suspension while holding an executive resource. For details, see “Security \r\nIssues” later in this paper.\r\n10 To use an executive resource, a driver must:\r\n1. Allocate an ERESOURCE structure from nonpaged pool.\r\n2. Initialize the resource by calling ExInitializeResourceLite, usually from a \r\nDriverEntry or AddDevice routine.\r\n3. Disable normal kernel-mode APCs before acquiring the resource. A device \r\ndriver calls KeEnterCriticalRegion; a file system driver calls \r\nFsRtlEnterFileSystem. If the driver routine is running in the context of a \r\nsystem thread, however, it generally does not need to disable APCs because \r\nthe thread is unlikely to be suspended.\r\n4. Acquire the resource by calling one of the resource acquisition routines listed in \r\nTable 9.\r\n5. Perform the required operations on the protected data.\r\n6. Release the resource by calling ExReleaseResourceLite.\r\n7. Re-enable normal kernel-mode APCs by calling KeLeaveCriticalRegion or \r\nFsRtlLeaveFileSystem.\r\nAll of the resource acquisition routines return a Boolean value that indicates\r\nwhether acquisition succeeded. When the thread acquires the resource, the \r\nacquisition routine returns TRUE. If the driver does not block and the resource is \r\nnot available, the routine returns FALSE.\r\nUnlike fast mutexes and spin locks, executive resources can be acquired \r\nrecursively. A thread that acquires an executive resource recursively must release \r\nthe resource as many times as it was acquired. Recursive acquisition of resources \r\nis common in file system drivers. For example, a file system driver might implement \r\na cache by mapping files into a reserved area in virtual memory. The driver holds \r\ncertain locks while it processes the cached data. If that processing causes a page \r\nfault, the operating system generates an additional I/O request, which is sent to the ",

To \r\nhandle the additional I/O request, the file system driver must recursively acquire \r\nsome of the same locks it uses when processing the cached I/O.\r\nExecutive resources are similar to fast mutexes in that a thread that tries to acquire \r\na resource while another thread has exclusive access to it will block. While this\r\nthread is waiting, other threads in the Ready state run.\r\n11 Callback Objects\r\nCallback objects are useful for synchronization and notification between kernel\u0002mode routines. Callback objects are kernel-mode only; they cannot be shared with \r\nuser-mode applications.\r\nA driver creates a callback object by calling ExCreateCallback. Users of the object \r\nregister a callback routine by calling ExRegisterCallback. When the driver\u0002specified callback conditions occur, the driver calls ExNotifyCallback to request \r\nthat the callback routines be run. ExNotifyCallback can be called at \r\nIRQL<=DISPATCH_LEVEL, and the callback routines are called at the same IRQL\r\nat which ExNotifyCallback was called, in the context of the notifying thread. If your \r\ndriver registers a callback routine, be sure that you know the IRQL at which \r\nnotification takes place and code the callback routine appropriately.\r\n12 Driver-Defined Locks\r\nIn addition to the synchronization mechanisms provided by the operating system, \r\ndrivers can define their own locks. If you implement a driver-defined lock, you must \r\nkeep in mind that optimizing compilers and certain hardware architectures \r\nsometimes reorder read and write instructions to improve performance. To prevent \r\nsuch reordering, driver code sometimes requires a memory barrier.\r\nA memory barrier is a processor instruction that preserves the ordering of read and \r\nwrite operations, as seen from the perspective of any other processor. The \r\noperating system’s locking mechanisms (spin locks, fast mutexes, kernel dispatcher \r\nobjects, and executive resources) all have implied memory barriers that preserve \r\nthe ordering of instructions.\r\nIf you create your own locks, you might need to put memory barriers in the locked \r\ncode to ensure the correct results. The ExInterlockedXxx and InterlockedXxx\r\nroutines and the KeMemoryBarrier and KeMemoryBarrierWithoutFence routines \r\ninsert memory barriers to prevent such reordering.\r\nFor details about memory barriers and processor reordering, see the white paper \r\n“Memory Barriers on Multiprocessor Architectures,” which is available at \r\nwww.microsoft.com/hwdev.\r\n13 Using Multiple Synchronization Mechanisms \r\nSimultaneously\r\nAttempting to acquire two or more synchronization mechanisms at once can cause \r\na deadlock if this is done improperly. For this reason, the Windows DDK advises \r\ndriver writers to never acquire more than one lock at a time. However, in some \r\nsituations, using multiple locks is appropriate, or even necessary.\r\nFor example, a driver might maintain two lists that require protection at IRQL \r\nDISPATCH_LEVEL. Most code accesses only one of the lists at any given time. \r\nOccasionally, however, a driver routine must move an item from one list to another. ",

If a driver routine running \r\nin Thread 1 acquires the lock to update the first list, another driver routine running in \r\nThread 2 must wait to access the second list.\r\nA better solution is to protect each list with its own spin lock.

All rights reserved.\r\n15 Security Issues\r\nDrivers that use locks at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL outside a critical region are open \r\nto denial of service attacks if the thread that holds the lock is suspended. This \r\nproblem occurs because Windows queues a normal kernel-mode APC to suspend \r\nthe thread. Even if the driver specifies a KernelMode wait, normal kernel-mode \r\nAPCs are delivered whenever all of the following are true:\r\n The target thread is running at IRQL < APC_LEVEL.\r\n The target thread is not already running an APC.\r\n The target thread is not in a critical region; that is, it did not call \r\nKeEnterCriticalRegion before calling KeWaitXxx.\r\nNote\r\nKernel mutexes and fast mutexes do not have this problem. The operating system \r\nenters a critical region before it acquires a fast mutex or kernel mutex on behalf of a \r\nthread.\r\nConsider the following scenario:\r\nWhile it is handling an I/O request from a user-mode application, a driver waits for a \r\nkernel dispatcher object (other than a mutex) or acquires an executive resource.\r\nThe driver requests a KernelMode wait that is not alertable: that is, the WaitMode\r\nparameter is KernelMode and the Alertable parameter is FALSE.\r\nAssume that the requesting application has a second thread running. If the second \r\nthread acquires a handle to the thread that requested the I/O operation, it can \r\nsuspend the requesting thread, thus rendering the driver – and possibly the whole \r\nsystem—unusable.\r\nTo eliminate this possible security threat, a driver should enter a critical region \r\n(disable APCs) before calling KeWaitXxx. To disable and subsequently re-enable \r\nAPCs, a device driver calls KeEnterCriticalRegion and KeLeaveCriticalRegion; a \r\nfile system driver calls the FsRtlEnterFileSystem and FsRtlLeaveFileSystem\r\nmacros. A driver can check whether normal kernel-mode APCs are disabled by \r\ncalling KeAreApcsDisabled. KeAreApcsDisabled is available on Windows XP \r\nand later releases of Windows.\r\n16 Performance Issues\r\nAlthough nearly every driver requires spin locks and other synchronization \r\nmechanisms, these mechanisms by their very nature can cause performance \r\nbottlenecks. Follow these guidelines to improve performance in synchronization \r\ncode:\r\n Use locks only when necessary. For example, to gather statistical information, \r\nuse per-processor data structures instead of a single, system-wide data \r\nstructure that requires a lock.\r\n Use executive resources (ERESOURCE structures) to protect read/write data at \r\nIRQL < DISPATCH_LEVEL, so that multiple readers can be active at once.\r\n Use fast mutexes or executive resources instead of kernel dispatcher objects\r\nwhenever possible. Because fast mutexes and executive resources are not \r\nmaintained in the dispatcher database, the system can acquire them without \r\nusing the dispatcher lock. As a result, they are faster and contribute to better \r\nperformance system-wide.",

These routines do not \r\nacquire a spin lock and are therefore relatively fast.\r\n Use an in-stack queued spin lock instead of an ordinary spin lock whenever \r\nseveral components might frequently contend for the lock\r\n Use the ExTryToAcquireXxx routines to acquire a lock whenever possible, \r\nparticularly if you have established a locking hierarchy and are using multiple, \r\nnested locks. If you need to wait for the second or third lock in a hierarchy, \r\nconsider releasing the locks that you have already acquired so that another \r\nthread that might need fewer locks can proceed, and then later reacquire the \r\nlocks from the top of the hierarchy.\r\n Minimize the number of times your driver calls routines that use the dispatcher \r\nlock. Such routines include those to wait on a dispatcher object \r\n(KeWaitForSingleObject, KeWaitForMultipleObjects, and \r\nKeWaitForMutexObject) and calls that set and release dispatcher objects \r\n(KeSetEvent, KeReleaseSemaphore, and so forth). Frequent use of the \r\ndispatcher lock can slow performance system-wide because calls that require it \r\nmust sometimes spin.\r\n Hold each spin lock for the minimum amount of time necessary, particularly if \r\nthe lock is frequently required by other code. For example, traversing a long,\r\nlinked list in a linear order while holding a heavily used spin lock can cause a \r\nperformance bottleneck.\r\n17 Best Practices for Driver Synchronization\r\nTo avoid problems related to synchronization in drivers, adopt these practices:\r\n Determine the highest IRQL at which any code can access the data.\r\n If any code that accesses the data runs at IRQL>=DISPATCH_LEVEL, you \r\nmust use a spin lock.\r\n If all code runs at IRQL PASSIVE_LEVEL or APC_LEVEL, you can use an \r\nexecutive resource, a fast mutex, or one of the kernel dispatcher objects—\r\nwhichever is best suited to the driver’s requirements.\r\n To synchronize driver execution with a user-mode application, define a private \r\nIOCTL and use either an event that is defined by the user-mode application or \r\nan I/O request that the driver completes to notify the application.\r\n To prevent thread suspension, a driver should enter a critical region before \r\nacquiring an executive resource or waiting for a kernel-dispatcher object (other \r\nthan a mutex) at IRQL=PASSIVE_LEVEL.\r\n To manage lists or to perform arithmetic or logical operations on a single \r\nmemory location, use the ExInterlockedXxx and the InterlockedXxx routines.\r\n Test every driver on as many different hardware configurations as possible. \r\nAlways test drivers on multiprocessor systems to find errors that are related to \r\nlocking, multi-threading, and concurrency.\r\n Use Driver Verifier (verifier.exe) to test for IRQL and synchronization issues.\r\nUse the Forced IRQL Checking option to ensure that spin locks are not used at \r\nthe wrong IRQL.\r\n Use the Driver Verifier global counters to monitor IRQL raises and spin lock \r\nacquisitions.\r\n Use Call Usage Verifier (CUV) to check whether the spin locks are allocated \r\nand used consistently.",
