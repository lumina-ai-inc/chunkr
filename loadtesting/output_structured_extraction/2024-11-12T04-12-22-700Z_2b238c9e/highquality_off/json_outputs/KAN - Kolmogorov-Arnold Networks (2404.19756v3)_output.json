KANs are mathematically sound, accurate and interpretable.\r\nsplines would fail for large N due to COD; MLPs can potentially learn the the generalized additive\r\nstructure, but they are very inefficient for approximating the exponential and sine functions with say,\r\nReLU activations. In contrast, KANs can learn both the compositional structure and the univariate\r\nfunctions quite well, hence outperforming MLPs by a large margin (see Figure 3.1).\r\nThroughout this paper, we will use extensive numerical experiments to show that KANs can lead to\r\naccuracy and interpretability improvement over MLPs, at least on small-scale AI + Science tasks.\r\nThe organization of the paper is illustrated in Figure 2.1. In Section 2, we introduce the KAN archi\u0002tecture and its mathematical foundation, introduce network simplification techniques to make KANs\r\ninterpretable, and introduce a grid extension technique to make KANs more accurate. In Section 3,\r\nwe show that KANs are more accurate than MLPs for data fitting: KANs can beat the curse of dimen\u0002sionality when there is a compositional structure in data, achieving better scaling laws than MLPs.\r\nWe also demonstrate the potential of KANs in PDE solving via a simple example of the Poisson\r\nequation. In Section 4, we show that KANs are interpretable and can be used for scientific discov\u0002eries. We use two examples from mathematics (knot theory) and physics (Anderson localization) to\r\ndemonstrate that KANs can be helpful “collaborators” for scientists to (re)discover math and phys\u0002ical laws. Section 5 summarizes related works. In Section 6, we conclude by discussing broad im\u0002pacts and future directions.

We instead\r\nfocus on the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which can be realized by a new type of\r\nneural network called Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN). We review the Kolmogorov-Arnold\r\ntheorem in Section 2.1, to inspire the design of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks in Section 2.2. In\r\nSection 2.3, we provide theoretical guarantees for the expressive power of KANs and their neural\r\nscaling laws, relating them to existing approximation and generalization theories in the literature.

Right: an activation function is\r\nparameterized as a B-spline, which allows switching between coarse-grained and fine-grained grids.\r\nsingle variable and the binary operation of addition. More specifically, for a smooth f : [0, 1]n → R,\r\nf(x) = f(x1, · · · , xn) =\r\n2\r\nXn+1\r\nq=1\r\nΦq\r\n Xn\r\np=1\r\nϕq,p(xp)\r\n!\r\n, (2.1)\r\nwhere ϕq,p : [0, 1] → R and Φq : R → R. In a sense, they showed that the only true multivariate\r\nfunction is addition, since every other function can be written using univariate functions and sum.\r\nOne might naively consider this great news for machine learning: learning a high-dimensional func\u0002tion boils down to learning a polynomial number of 1D functions. However, these 1D functions\r\ncan be non-smooth and even fractal, so they may not be learnable in practice [19]. Because of this\r\npathological behavior, the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem was basically sentenced to\r\ndeath in machine learning, regarded as theoretically sound but practically useless [19].\r\nHowever, we are more optimistic about the usefulness of the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem for ma\u0002chine learning. First of all, we need not stick to the original Eq. (2.1) which has only two-layer non\u0002linearities and a small number of terms (2n + 1) in the hidden layer: we will generalize the network\r\nto arbitrary widths and depths. Secondly, most functions in science and daily life are often smooth\r\nand have sparse compositional structures, potentially facilitating smooth Kolmogorov-Arnold rep\u0002resentations. The philosophy here is close to the mindset of physicists, who often care more about\r\ntypical cases rather than worst cases. After all, our physical world and machine learning tasks must\r\nhave structures to make physics and machine learning useful or generalizable at all [20].\r\n2.2 KAN architecture\r\nSuppose we have a supervised learning task consisting of input-output pairs {xi, yi}, where we want\r\nto find f such that yi ≈ f(xi) for all data points. Eq. (2.1) implies that we are done if we can find\r\nappropriate univariate functions ϕq,p and Φq. This inspires us to design a neural network which\r\nexplicitly parametrizes Eq. (2.1). Since all functions to be learned are univariate functions, we can\r\nparametrize each 1D function as a B-spline curve, with learnable coefficients of local B-spline basis\r\nfunctions (see Figure 2.2 right). Now we have a prototype of KAN, whose computation graph is\r\nexactly specified by Eq. (2.1) and illustrated in Figure 0.1 (b) (with the input dimension n = 2),\r\nappearing as a two-layer neural network with activation functions placed on edges instead of nodes\r\n(simple summation is performed on nodes), and with width 2n + 1 in the middle layer.\r\n4",

In contrast, our abstraction of KAN layers and their visualizations are\r\ncleaner and intuitive. The original Kolmogorov-Arnold representation Eq. (2.1) corresponds to a\r\n2-Layer KAN with shape [n, 2n + 1, 1]. Notice that all the operations are differentiable, so we can\r\ntrain KANs with back propagation. For comparison, an MLP can be written as interleaving of affine\r\ntransformations W and non-linearities σ:\r\nMLP(x) = (WL−1 ◦ σ ◦ WL−2 ◦ σ ◦ · · · ◦ W1 ◦ σ ◦ W0)x. (2.9)\r\nIt is clear that MLPs treat linear transformations and nonlinearities separately as W and σ, while\r\nKANs treat them all together in Φ. In Figure 0.1 (c) and (d), we visualize a three-layer MLP and a\r\nthree-layer KAN, to clarify their differences.\r\nImplementation details. Although a KAN layer Eq. (2.5) looks extremely simple, it is non-trivial\r\nto make it well optimizable. The key tricks are:\r\n(1) Residual activation functions. We include a basis function b(x) (similar to residual connec\u0002tions) such that the activation function ϕ(x) is the sum of the basis function b(x) and the spline\r\nfunction:\r\nϕ(x) = wbb(x) + wsspline(x). (2.10)\r\nWe set\r\nb(x) = silu(x) = x/(1 + e\r\n−x\r\n) (2.11)\r\nin most cases. spline(x) is parametrized as a linear combination of B-splines such that\r\nspline(x) = X\r\ni\r\nciBi(x) (2.12)\r\nwhere cis are trainable (see Figure 2.2 for an illustration). In principle wb and ws are redundant\r\nsince it can be absorbed into b(x) and spline(x). However, we still include these factors (which\r\nare by default trainable) to better control the overall magnitude of the activation function.\r\n(2) Initialization scales. Each activation function is initialized to have ws = 1 and spline(x) ≈ 0\r\n2\r\n.\r\nwb is initialized according to the Xavier initialization, which has been used to initialize linear\r\nlayers in MLPs.\r\n(3) Update of spline grids. We update each grid on the fly according to its input activations, to\r\naddress the issue that splines are defined on bounded regions but activation values can evolve\r\nout of the fixed region during training 3.\r\nParameter count. For simplicity, let us assume a network\r\n(1) of depth L,\r\n2This is done by drawing B-spline coefficients ci ∼ N (0, σ2\r\n) with a small σ, typically we set σ = 0.1.\r\n3Other possibilities are: (a) the grid is learnable with gradient descent, e.g., [21]; (b) use normalization such\r\nthat the input range is fixed. We tried (b) at first but its performance is inferior to our current approach.\r\n6",

In contrast, an MLP with depth\r\nL and width N only needs O(N2L) parameters, which appears to be more efficient than KAN. For\u0002tunately, KANs usually require much smaller N than MLPs, which not only saves parameters, but\r\nalso achieves better generalization (see e.g., Figure 3.1 and 3.3) and facilitates interpretability. We\r\nremark that for 1D problems, we can take N = L = 1 and the KAN network in our implementation\r\nis nothing but a spline approximation. For higher dimensions, we characterize the generalization\r\nbehavior of KANs with a theorem below.\r\n2.3 KAN’s Approximation Abilities and Scaling Laws\r\nRecall that in Eq. (2.1), the 2-Layer width-(2n + 1) representation may be non-smooth. How\u0002ever, deeper representations may bring the advantages of smoother activations. For example, the\r\n4-variable function\r\nf(x1, x2, x3, x4) = exp sin(x\r\n2\r\n1 + x\r\n2\r\n2\r\n) + sin(x\r\n2\r\n3 + x\r\n2\r\n4\r\n)\r\n\u0001\r\n(2.13)\r\ncan be smoothly represented by a [4, 2, 1, 1] KAN which is 3-Layer, but may not admit a 2-Layer\r\nKAN with smooth activations. To facilitate an approximation analysis, we still assume smoothness\r\nof activations, but allow the representations to be arbitrarily wide and deep, as in Eq. (2.7). To\r\nemphasize the dependence of our KAN on the finite set of grid points, we use ΦG\r\nl\r\nand Φ\r\nG\r\nl,i,j below\r\nto replace the notation Φl and Φl,i,j used in Eq. (2.5) and (2.6).\r\nTheorem 2.1 (Approximation theory, KAT). Let x = (x1, x2, · · · , xn). Suppose that a function\r\nf(x) admits a representation\r\nf = (ΦL−1 ◦ ΦL−2 ◦ · · · ◦ Φ1 ◦ Φ0)x , (2.14)\r\nas in Eq. (2.7), where each one of the Φl,i,j are (k + 1)-times continuously differentiable. Then\r\nthere exists a constant C depending on f and its representation, such that we have the following\r\napproximation bound in terms of the grid size G: there exist k-th order B-spline functions Φ\r\nG\r\nl,i,j\r\nsuch that for any 0 ≤ m ≤ k, we have the bound\r\n∥f − (ΦG\r\nL−1 ◦ ΦG\r\nL−2 ◦ · · · ◦ ΦG\r\n1 ◦ ΦG\r\n0\r\n)x∥Cm ≤ CG−k−1+m . (2.15)\r\nHere we adopt the notation of C\r\nm-norm measuring the magnitude of derivatives up to order m:\r\n∥g∥Cm = max\r\n|β|≤m\r\nsup\r\nx∈[0,1]n\r\n\f\r\n\fDβ\r\ng(x)\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n.\r\nProof. By the classical 1D B-spline theory [22] and the fact that Φl,i,j as continuous functions can\r\nbe uniformly bounded on a bounded domain, we know that there exist finite-grid B-spline functions\r\nΦ\r\nG\r\nl,i,j such that for any 0 ≤ m ≤ k,\r\n∥(Φl,i,j ◦Φl−1 ◦Φl−2 ◦· · ·◦Φ1 ◦Φ0)x−(ΦG\r\nl,i,j ◦Φl−1 ◦Φl−2 ◦· · ·◦Φ1 ◦Φ0)x∥Cm ≤ CG−k−1+m ,\r\nwith a constant C independent of G. We fix those B-spline approximations. Therefore we have that\r\nthe residue Rl defined via\r\nRl\r\n:= (ΦG\r\nL−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ΦG\r\nl+1 ◦ Φl ◦ Φl−1 ◦ · · · ◦ Φ0)x − (ΦG\r\nL−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ΦGl+1 ◦ ΦGl ◦ Φl−1 ◦ · · · ◦ Φ0)x\r\n7",

In contrast, an MLP with depth\r\nL and width N only needs O(N2L) parameters, which appears to be more efficient than KAN. For\u0002tunately, KANs usually require much smaller N than MLPs, which not only saves parameters, but\r\nalso achieves better generalization (see e.g., Figure 3.1 and 3.3) and facilitates interpretability. We\r\nremark that for 1D problems, we can take N = L = 1 and the KAN network in our implementation\r\nis nothing but a spline approximation. For higher dimensions, we characterize the generalization\r\nbehavior of KANs with a theorem below.\r\n2.3 KAN’s Approximation Abilities and Scaling Laws\r\nRecall that in Eq. (2.1), the 2-Layer width-(2n + 1) representation may be non-smooth. How\u0002ever, deeper representations may bring the advantages of smoother activations. For example, the\r\n4-variable function\r\nf(x1, x2, x3, x4) = exp sin(x\r\n2\r\n1 + x\r\n2\r\n2\r\n) + sin(x\r\n2\r\n3 + x\r\n2\r\n4\r\n)\r\n\u0001\r\n(2.13)\r\ncan be smoothly represented by a [4, 2, 1, 1] KAN which is 3-Layer, but may not admit a 2-Layer\r\nKAN with smooth activations. To facilitate an approximation analysis, we still assume smoothness\r\nof activations, but allow the representations to be arbitrarily wide and deep, as in Eq. (2.7). To\r\nemphasize the dependence of our KAN on the finite set of grid points, we use ΦG\r\nl\r\nand Φ\r\nG\r\nl,i,j below\r\nto replace the notation Φl and Φl,i,j used in Eq. (2.5) and (2.6).\r\nTheorem 2.1 (Approximation theory, KAT). Let x = (x1, x2, · · · , xn). Suppose that a function\r\nf(x) admits a representation\r\nf = (ΦL−1 ◦ ΦL−2 ◦ · · · ◦ Φ1 ◦ Φ0)x , (2.14)\r\nas in Eq. (2.7), where each one of the Φl,i,j are (k + 1)-times continuously differentiable. Then\r\nthere exists a constant C depending on f and its representation, such that we have the following\r\napproximation bound in terms of the grid size G: there exist k-th order B-spline functions Φ\r\nG\r\nl,i,j\r\nsuch that for any 0 ≤ m ≤ k, we have the bound\r\n∥f − (ΦG\r\nL−1 ◦ ΦG\r\nL−2 ◦ · · · ◦ ΦG\r\n1 ◦ ΦG\r\n0\r\n)x∥Cm ≤ CG−k−1+m . (2.15)\r\nHere we adopt the notation of C\r\nm-norm measuring the magnitude of derivatives up to order m:\r\n∥g∥Cm = max\r\n|β|≤m\r\nsup\r\nx∈[0,1]n\r\n\f\r\n\fDβ\r\ng(x)\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n.\r\nProof. By the classical 1D B-spline theory [22] and the fact that Φl,i,j as continuous functions can\r\nbe uniformly bounded on a bounded domain, we know that there exist finite-grid B-spline functions\r\nΦ\r\nG\r\nl,i,j such that for any 0 ≤ m ≤ k,\r\n∥(Φl,i,j ◦Φl−1 ◦Φl−2 ◦· · ·◦Φ1 ◦Φ0)x−(ΦG\r\nl,i,j ◦Φl−1 ◦Φl−2 ◦· · ·◦Φ1 ◦Φ0)x∥Cm ≤ CG−k−1+m ,\r\nwith a constant C independent of G. We fix those B-spline approximations. Therefore we have that\r\nthe residue Rl defined via\r\nRl\r\n:= (ΦG\r\nL−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ΦG\r\nl+1 ◦ Φl ◦ Φl−1 ◦ · · · ◦ Φ0)x − (ΦG\r\nL−1 ◦ · · · ◦ ΦGl+1 ◦ ΦGl ◦ Φl−1 ◦ · · · ◦ Φ0)x\r\n7",

Bottom right: training time scales favorably with grid size G.\r\nKAT and UAT is a consequence that KANs take advantage of the intrinsically low-dimensional rep\u0002resentation of the function while MLPs do not. In KAT, we highlight quantifying the approximation\r\nerror in the compositional space. In the literature, generalization error bounds, taking into account\r\nfinite samples of training data, for a similar space have been studied for regression problems; see\r\n[25, 26], and also specifically for MLPs with ReLU activations [27]. On the other hand, for general\r\nfunction spaces like Sobolev or Besov spaces, the nonlinear n-widths theory [28, 29, 30] indicates\r\nthat we can never beat the curse of dimensionality, while MLPs with ReLU activations can achieve\r\nthe tight rate [31, 32, 33]. This fact again motivates us to consider functions of compositional struc\u0002ture, the much \"nicer\" functions that we encounter in practice and in science, to overcome the COD.\r\nCompared with MLPs, we may use a smaller architecture in practice, since we learn general non\u0002linear activation functions; see also [27] where the depth of the ReLU MLPs needs to reach at least\r\nlog n to have the desired rate, where n is the number of samples. Indeed, we will show that KANs\r\nare nicely aligned with symbolic functions while MLPs are not.\r\n2.4 For accuracy: Grid Extension\r\nIn principle, a spline can be made arbitrarily accurate to a target function as the grid can be made\r\narbitrarily fine-grained. This good feature is inherited by KANs. By contrast, MLPs do not have\r\nthe notion of “fine-graining”. Admittedly, increasing the width and depth of MLPs can lead to\r\nimprovement in performance (“neural scaling laws”). However, these neural scaling laws are slow\r\n(discussed in the last section). They are also expensive to obtain, because models of varying sizes\r\nare trained independently. By contrast, for KANs, one can first train a KAN with fewer parameters\r\nand then extend it to a KAN with more parameters by simply making its spline grids finer, without\r\nthe need to retraining the larger model from scratch.\r\nWe next describe how to perform grid extension (illustrated in Figure 2.2 right), which is basi\u0002cally fitting a new fine-grained spline to an old coarse-grained spline. Suppose we want to ap\u0002proximate a 1D function f in a bounded region [a, b] with B-splines of order k. A coarse-grained\r\n9",

Bottom left: test RMSE follows scaling laws against grid\r\nsize G. Bottom right: training time scales favorably with grid size G.\r\nKAT and UAT is a consequence that KANs take advantage of the intrinsically low-dimensional rep\u0002resentation of the function while MLPs do not. In KAT, we highlight quantifying the approximation\r\nerror in the compositional space. In the literature, generalization error bounds, taking into account\r\nfinite samples of training data, for a similar space have been studied for regression problems; see\r\n[25, 26], and also specifically for MLPs with ReLU activations [27]. On the other hand, for general\r\nfunction spaces like Sobolev or Besov spaces, the nonlinear n-widths theory [28, 29, 30] indicates\r\nthat we can never beat the curse of dimensionality, while MLPs with ReLU activations can achieve\r\nthe tight rate [31, 32, 33]. This fact again motivates us to consider functions of compositional struc\u0002ture, the much \"nicer\" functions that we encounter in practice and in science, to overcome the COD.\r\nCompared with MLPs, we may use a smaller architecture in practice, since we learn general non\u0002linear activation functions; see also [27] where the depth of the ReLU MLPs needs to reach at least\r\nlog n to have the desired rate, where n is the number of samples. Indeed, we will show that KANs\r\nare nicely aligned with symbolic functions while MLPs are not.\r\n2.4 For accuracy: Grid Extension\r\nIn principle, a spline can be made arbitrarily accurate to a target function as the grid can be made\r\narbitrarily fine-grained. This good feature is inherited by KANs. By contrast, MLPs do not have\r\nthe notion of “fine-graining”. Admittedly, increasing the width and depth of MLPs can lead to\r\nimprovement in performance (“neural scaling laws”). However, these neural scaling laws are slow\r\n(discussed in the last section). They are also expensive to obtain, because models of varying sizes\r\nare trained independently. By contrast, for KANs, one can first train a KAN with fewer parameters\r\nand then extend it to a KAN with more parameters by simply making its spline grids finer, without\r\nthe need to retraining the larger model from scratch.\r\nWe next describe how to perform grid extension (illustrated in Figure 2.2 right), which is basi\u0002cally fitting a new fine-grained spline to an old coarse-grained spline. Suppose we want to ap\u0002proximate a 1D function f in a bounded region [a, b] with B-splines of order k. A coarse-grained\r\n9",

            "content": "External vs Internal degrees of freedom. A new concept that KANs highlights is a distinction\r\nbetween external versus internal degrees of freedom (parameters). The computational graph of how\r\nnodes are connected represents external degrees of freedom (“dofs”), while the grid points inside\r\nan activation function are internal degrees of freedom. KANs benefit from the fact that they have\r\nboth external dofs and internal dofs. External dofs (that MLPs also have but splines do not) are\r\nresponsible for learning compositional structures of multiple variables. Internal dofs (that splines\r\nalso have but MLPs do not) are responsible for learning univariate functions.\r\n2.5 For Interpretability: Simplifying KANs and Making them interactive\r\nOne loose end from the last subsection is that we do not know how to choose the KAN shape that\r\nbest matches the structure of a dataset. For example, if we know that the dataset is generated via the\r\nsymbolic formula f(x, y) = exp(sin(πx)+y\r\n2\r\n), then we know that a [2, 1, 1] KAN is able to express\r\nthis function. However, in practice we do not know the information a priori, so it would be nice to\r\nhave approaches to determine this shape automatically. The idea is to start from a large enough KAN\r\nand train it with sparsity regularization followed by pruning. We will show that these pruned KANs\r\nare much more interpretable than non-pruned ones. To make KANs maximally interpretable, we\r\npropose a few simplification techniques in Section 2.5.1, and an example of how users can interact\r\nwith KANs to make them more interpretable in Section 2.5.2.\r\n2.5.1 Simplification techniques\r\n1. Sparsification. For MLPs, L1 regularization of linear weights is used to favor sparsity. KANs\r\ncan adapt this high-level idea, but need two modifications:\r\n(1) There is no linear “weight” in KANs. Linear weights are replaced by learnable activation func\u0002tions, so we should define the L1 norm of these activation functions.\r\n(2) We find L1 to be insufficient for sparsification of KANs; instead an additional entropy regular\u0002ization is necessary (see Appendix C for more details).\r\nWe define the L1 norm of an activation function ϕ to be its average magnitude over its Np inputs,\r\ni.e.,\r\n|ϕ|\r\n1 ≡\r\n1\r\nNp\r\nX\r\nNp\r\ns=1\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\fϕ(x\r\n(s)\r\n)\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\f . (2.17)\r\nThen for a KAN layer Φ with nin inputs and nout outputs, we define the L1 norm of Φ to be the\r\nsum of L1 norms of all activation functions, i.e.,\r\n|Φ|\r\n1 ≡\r\nXnin\r\ni=1\r\nnXout\r\nj=1\r\n|ϕi,j |\r\n1\r\n. (2.18)\r\nIn addition, we define the entropy of Φ to be\r\nS(Φ) ≡ −Xnin\r\ni=1\r\nnXout\r\nj=1\r\n|ϕi,j |\r\n1\r\n|Φ|\r\n1\r\nlog \u0012\r\n|ϕi,j |\r\n1\r\n|Φ|\r\n1\r\n\u0013\r\n.

            "content": "Figure 2.4: An example of how to do symbolic regression with KAN.\r\n2. Visualization. When we visualize a KAN, to get a sense of magnitudes, we set the transparency\r\nof an activation function ϕl,i,j proportional to tanh(βAl,i,j ) where β = 3 . Hence, functions with\r\nsmall magnitude appear faded out to allow us to focus on important ones.\r\n3. Pruning. After training with sparsification penalty, we may also want to prune the network to a\r\nsmaller subnetwork. We sparsify KANs on the node level (rather than on the edge level). For each\r\nnode (say the i\r\nth neuron in the lth layer), we define its incoming and outgoing score as\r\nIl,i = max\r\nk\r\n(|ϕl−1,i,k|\r\n1\r\n), Ol,i = max\r\nj\r\n(|ϕl+1,j,i|\r\n1\r\n), (2.21)\r\nand consider a node to be important if both incoming and outgoing scores are greater than a threshold\r\nhyperparameter θ = 10−2 by default. All unimportant neurons are pruned.\r\n4. Symbolification. In cases where we suspect that some activation functions are in fact sym\u0002bolic (e.g., cos or log), we provide an interface to set them to be a specified symbolic form,\r\nfix_symbolic(l,i,j,f) can set the (l, i, j) activation to be f. However, we cannot simply set\r\nthe activation function to be the exact symbolic formula, since its inputs and outputs may have shifts\r\nand scalings. So, we obtain preactivations x and postactivations y from samples, and fit affine pa\u0002rameters (a, b, c, d) such that y ≈ cf(ax + b) + d. The fitting is done by iterative grid search of a, b\r\nand linear regression.\r\nBesides these techniques, we provide additional tools that allow users to apply more fine-grained\r\ncontrol to KANs, listed in Appendix A.\r\n2.5.2 A toy example: how humans can interact with KANs\r\nAbove we have proposed a number of simplification techniques for KANs. We can view these\r\nsimplification choices as buttons one can click on. A user interacting with these buttons can decide\r\nwhich button is most promising to click next to make KANs more interpretable. We use an example\r\nbelow to showcase how a user could interact with a KAN to obtain maximally interpretable results.\r\nLet us again consider the regression task\r\nf(x, y) = exp sin(πx) + y\r\n2\r\n\u0001\r\n.

            "content": "Given data points (xi\r\n, yi, fi), i = 1, 2, · · · , Np, a hypothetical user Alice is interested in figuring\r\nout the symbolic formula. The steps of Alice’s interaction with the KANs are described below\r\n(illustrated in Figure 2.4):\r\nStep 1: Training with sparsification. Starting from a fully-connected [2, 5, 1] KAN, training with\r\nsparsification regularization can make it quite sparse. 4 out of 5 neurons in the hidden layer appear\r\nuseless, hence we want to prune them away.\r\nStep 2: Pruning. Automatic pruning is seen to discard all hidden neurons except the last one,\r\nleaving a [2, 1, 1] KAN. The activation functions appear to be known symbolic functions.\r\nStep 3: Setting symbolic functions. Assuming that the user can correctly guess these symbolic\r\nformulas from staring at the KAN plot, they can set\r\nfix_symbolic(0,0,0,‘sin’)\r\nfix_symbolic(0,1,0,‘xˆ2’)\r\nfix_symbolic(1,0,0,‘exp’).\r\n(2.23)\r\nIn case the user has no domain knowledge or no idea which symbolic functions these activation\r\nfunctions might be, we provide a function suggest_symbolic to suggest symbolic candidates.\r\nStep 4: Further training. After symbolifying all the activation functions in the network, the only\r\nremaining parameters are the affine parameters. We continue training these affine parameters, and\r\nwhen we see the loss dropping to machine precision, we know that we have found the correct sym\u0002bolic expression.\r\nStep 5: Output the symbolic formula. Sympy is used to compute the symbolic formula of the\r\noutput node. The user obtains 1.0e\r\n1.0y\r\n2+1.0sin(3.14x)\r\n, which is the true answer (we only displayed\r\ntwo decimals for π).\r\nRemark: Why not symbolic regression (SR)? It is reasonable to use symbolic regression for this\r\nexample. However, symbolic regression methods are in general brittle and hard to debug. They\r\neither return a success or a failure in the end without outputting interpretable intermediate results.\r\nIn contrast, KANs do continuous search (with gradient descent) in function space, so their results\r\nare more continuous and hence more robust. Moreover, users have more control over KANs as\r\ncompared to SR due to KANs’ transparency. The way we visualize KANs is like displaying KANs’\r\n“brain” to users, and users can perform “surgery” (debugging) on KANs. This level of control is\r\ntypically unavailable for SR. We will show examples of this in Section 4.4. More generally, when the\r\ntarget function is not symbolic, symbolic regression will fail but KANs can still provide something\r\nmeaningful. For example, a special function (e.g., a Bessel function) is impossible to SR to learn\r\nunless it is provided in advance, but KANs can use splines to approximate it numerically anyway\r\n(see Figure 4.1 (d)).\r\n3 KANs are accurate\r\nIn this section, we demonstrate that KANs are more effective at representing functions than MLPs\r\nin various tasks (regression and PDE solving). When comparing two families of models, it is fair to\r\ncompare both their accuracy (loss) and their complexity (number of parameters). We will show that\r\nKANs display more favorable Pareto Frontiers than MLPs. Moreover, in Section 3.5, we show that\r\nKANs can naturally work in continual learning without catastrophic forgetting.\r\n13",

KANs can almost saturate the fastest scaling law\r\npredicted by our theory (α = 4), while MLPs scales slowly and plateau quickly.\r\n3.1 Toy datasets\r\nIn Section 2.3, our theory suggested that test RMSE loss ℓ scales as ℓ ∝ N −4 with model parameters\r\nN. However, this relies on the existence of a Kolmogorov-Arnold representation. As a sanity check,\r\nwe construct five examples we know have smooth KA representations:\r\n(1) f(x) = J0(20x), which is the Bessel function. Since it is a univariate function, it can be\r\nrepresented by a spline, which is a [1, 1] KAN.\r\n(2) f(x, y) = exp(sin(πx) + y\r\n2\r\n). We know that it can be exactly represented by a [2, 1, 1] KAN.\r\n(3) f(x, y) = xy. We know from Figure 4.1 that it can be exactly represented by a [2, 2, 1] KAN.\r\n(4) A high-dimensional example f(x1, · · · , x100) = exp( 1\r\n100\r\nP100\r\ni=1 sin2\r\n(\r\nπxi\r\n2\r\n)) which can be rep\u0002resented by a [100, 1, 1] KAN.\r\n(5) A four-dimensional example f(x1, x2, x3, x4) = exp( 1\r\n2\r\n(sin(π(x\r\n2\r\n1 + x\r\n2\r\n2\r\n)) + sin(π(x\r\n2\r\n3 + x\r\n2\r\n4\r\n))))\r\nwhich can be represented by a [4, 4, 2, 1] KAN.\r\nWe train these KANs by increasing grid points every 200 steps, in total covering G =\r\n{3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000}. We train MLPs with different depths and widths as base\u0002lines. Both MLPs and KANs are trained with LBFGS for 1800 steps in total. We plot test RMSE as\r\na function of the number of parameters for KANs and MLPs in Figure 3.1, showing that KANs have\r\nbetter scaling curves than MLPs, especially for the high-dimensional example. For comparison, we\r\nplot the lines predicted from our KAN theory as red dashed (α = k + 1 = 4), and the lines predicted\r\nfrom Sharma & Kaplan [23] as black-dashed (α = (k+ 1)/d = 4/d). KANs can almost saturate the\r\nsteeper red lines, while MLPs struggle to converge even as fast as the slower black lines and plateau\r\nquickly. We also note that for the last example, the 2-Layer KAN [4, 9, 1] behaves much worse than\r\nthe 3-Layer KAN (shape [4, 2, 2, 1]). This highlights the greater expressive power of deeper KANs,\r\nwhich is the same for MLPs: deeper MLPs have more expressive power than shallower ones. Note\r\nthat we have adopted the vanilla setup where both KANs and MLPs are trained with LBFGS with\u0002out advanced techniques, e.g., switching between Adam and LBFGS, or boosting [34]. We leave the\r\ncomparison of KANs and MLPs in advanced setups for future work.\r\n3.2 Special functions\r\nOne caveat for the above results is that we assume knowledge of the “true” KAN shape. In practice,\r\nwe do not know the existence of KA representations. Even when we are promised that such a KA\r\nrepresentation exists, we do not know the KAN shape a priori. Special functions in more than\r\none variables are such cases, because it would be (mathematically) surprising if multivariate special\r\nfunctions (e.g., a Bessel function f(ν, x) = Jν(x)) could be written in KA represenations, involving\r\nonly univariate functions and sums). We show below that:\r\n14",

As a sanity check,\r\nwe construct five examples we know have smooth KA representations:\r\n(1) f(x) = J0(20x), which is the Bessel function. Since it is a univariate function, it can be\r\nrepresented by a spline, which is a [1, 1] KAN.\r\n(2) f(x, y) = exp(sin(πx) + y\r\n2\r\n). We know that it can be exactly represented by a [2, 1, 1] KAN.\r\n(3) f(x, y) = xy. We know from Figure 4.1 that it can be exactly represented by a [2, 2, 1] KAN.\r\n(4) A high-dimensional example f(x1, · · · , x100) = exp( 1\r\n100\r\nP100\r\ni=1 sin2\r\n(\r\nπxi\r\n2\r\n)) which can be rep\u0002resented by a [100, 1, 1] KAN.\r\n(5) A four-dimensional example f(x1, x2, x3, x4) = exp( 1\r\n2\r\n(sin(π(x\r\n2\r\n1 + x\r\n2\r\n2\r\n)) + sin(π(x\r\n2\r\n3 + x\r\n2\r\n4\r\n))))\r\nwhich can be represented by a [4, 4, 2, 1] KAN.\r\nWe train these KANs by increasing grid points every 200 steps, in total covering G =\r\n{3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000}. We train MLPs with different depths and widths as base\u0002lines. Both MLPs and KANs are trained with LBFGS for 1800 steps in total. We plot test RMSE as\r\na function of the number of parameters for KANs and MLPs in Figure 3.1, showing that KANs have\r\nbetter scaling curves than MLPs, especially for the high-dimensional example. For comparison, we\r\nplot the lines predicted from our KAN theory as red dashed (α = k + 1 = 4), and the lines predicted\r\nfrom Sharma & Kaplan [23] as black-dashed (α = (k+ 1)/d = 4/d). KANs can almost saturate the\r\nsteeper red lines, while MLPs struggle to converge even as fast as the slower black lines and plateau\r\nquickly. We also note that for the last example, the 2-Layer KAN [4, 9, 1] behaves much worse than\r\nthe 3-Layer KAN (shape [4, 2, 2, 1]). This highlights the greater expressive power of deeper KANs,\r\nwhich is the same for MLPs: deeper MLPs have more expressive power than shallower ones. Note\r\nthat we have adopted the vanilla setup where both KANs and MLPs are trained with LBFGS with\u0002out advanced techniques, e.g., switching between Adam and LBFGS, or boosting [34]. We leave the\r\ncomparison of KANs and MLPs in advanced setups for future work.\r\n3.2 Special functions\r\nOne caveat for the above results is that we assume knowledge of the “true” KAN shape. In practice,\r\nwe do not know the existence of KA representations. Even when we are promised that such a KA\r\nrepresentation exists, we do not know the KAN shape a priori. Special functions in more than\r\none variables are such cases, because it would be (mathematically) surprising if multivariate special\r\nfunctions (e.g., a Bessel function f(ν, x) = Jν(x)) could be written in KA represenations, involving\r\nonly univariate functions and sums). We show below that:\r\n14",

The Feynman dataset collects many physics equations from Feynman’s text\u0002books [35, 36]. For our purpose, we are interested in problems in the Feynman_no_units dataset\r\nthat have at least 2 variables, since univariate problems are trivial for KANs (they simplify to 1D\r\nsplines). A sample equation from the Feynman dataset is the relativisic velocity addition formula\r\nf(u, v) = (u + v)/(1 + uv). (3.1)\r\nThe dataset can be constructed by randomly drawing ui ∈ (−1, 1), vi ∈ (−1, 1), and computing\r\nfi = f(ui, vi). Given many tuples (ui, vi, fi), a neural network is trained and aims to predict f\r\nfrom u and v. We are interested in (1) how well a neural network can perform on test samples; (2)\r\nhow much we can learn about the structure of the problem from neural networks.\r\n16",

The Feynman dataset collects many physics equations from Feynman’s text\u0002books [35, 36].

(3.1)\r\nThe dataset can be constructed by randomly drawing ui ∈ (−1, 1), vi ∈ (−1, 1), and computing\r\nfi = f(ui, vi). Given many tuples (ui, vi, fi), a neural network is trained and aims to predict f\r\nfrom u and v. We are interested in (1) how well a neural network can perform on test samples; (2)\r\nhow much we can learn about the structure of the problem from neural networks.\r\n16",

We conjecture that the Feynman datasets\r\nare too simple to let KANs make further improvements, in the sense that variable dependence is\r\nusually smooth or monotonic, which is in contrast to the complexity of special functions which\r\noften demonstrate oscillatory behavior.\r\nAuto-discovered KANs are smaller than human-constructed ones. We report the pruned KAN\r\nshape in two columns of Table 2; one column is for the minimal pruned KAN shape that can achieve\r\nreasonable loss (i.e., test RMSE smaller than 10−2); the other column is for the pruned KAN that\r\nachieves lowest test loss. For completeness, we visualize all 54 pruned KANs in Appendix D (Fig\u0002ure D.2 and D.3). It is interesting to observe that auto-discovered KAN shapes (for both minimal\r\nand best) are usually smaller than our human constructions. This means that KA representations can\r\nbe more efficient than we imagine. At the same time, this may make interpretability subtle because\r\ninformation is being squashed into a smaller space than what we are comfortable with.\r\nConsider the relativistic velocity composition f(u, v) = u+v\r\n1+uv\r\n, for example. Our construction is\r\nquite deep because we were assuming that multiplication of u, v would use two layers (see Figure 4.1\r\n(a)), inversion of 1 + uv would use one layer, and multiplication of u + v and 1/(1 + uv) would\r\nuse another two layers6, resulting a total of 5 layers. However, the auto-discovered KANs are only 2\r\nlayers deep! In hindsight, this is actually expected if we recall the rapidity trick in relativity: define\r\nthe two “rapidities” a ≡ arctanh u and b ≡ arctanh v. The relativistic composition of velocities\r\nare simple additions in rapidity space, i.e., u+v\r\n1+uv = tanh(arctanh u + arctanh v), which can be\r\nrealized by a two-layer KAN. Pretending we do not know the notion of rapidity in physics, we could\r\npotentially discover this concept right from KANs without trial-and-error symbolic manipulations.\r\nThe interpretability of KANs which can facilitate scientific discovery is the main topic in Section 4.\r\n17",

At the same time, this may make interpretability subtle because\r\ninformation is being squashed into a smaller space than what we are comfortable with.\r\nConsider the relativistic velocity composition f(u, v) = u+v\r\n1+uv\r\n, for example. Our construction is\r\nquite deep because we were assuming that multiplication of u, v would use two layers (see Figure 4.1\r\n(a)), inversion of 1 + uv would use one layer, and multiplication of u + v and 1/(1 + uv) would\r\nuse another two layers6, resulting a total of 5 layers. However, the auto-discovered KANs are only 2\r\nlayers deep! In hindsight, this is actually expected if we recall the rapidity trick in relativity: define\r\nthe two “rapidities” a ≡ arctanh u and b ≡ arctanh v. The relativistic composition of velocities\r\nare simple additions in rapidity space, i.e., u+v\r\n1+uv = tanh(arctanh u + arctanh v), which can be\r\nrealized by a two-layer KAN. Pretending we do not know the notion of rapidity in physics, we could\r\npotentially discover this concept right from KANs without trial-and-error symbolic manipulations.\r\nThe interpretability of KANs which can facilitate scientific discovery is the main topic in Section 4.\r\n17",

We use the framework of physics-informed neural networks\r\n(PINNs) [37, 38] to solve this PDE, with the loss function given by\r\nlosspde = αlossi + lossb\r\n:= α\r\n1\r\nni\r\nXni\r\ni=1\r\n|uxx(zi) + uyy(zi) − f(zi)|\r\n2 +\r\n1\r\nnb\r\nXnb\r\ni=1\r\nu\r\n2\r\n,\r\nwhere we use lossito denote the interior loss, discretized and evaluated by a uniform sampling of ni\r\npoints zi = (xi, yi) inside the domain, and similarly we use lossb to denote the boundary loss, dis\u0002cretized and evaluated by a uniform sampling of nb points on the boundary. α is the hyperparameter\r\nbalancing the effect of the two terms.\r\nWe compare the KAN architecture with that of MLPs using the same hyperparameters ni = 10000,\r\nnb = 800, and α = 0.01. We measure both the error in the L\r\n2 norm and energy (H1\r\n) norm\r\nand see that KAN achieves a much better scaling law with a smaller error, using smaller networks\r\nand fewer parameters; see Figure 3.3. A 2-Layer width-10 KAN is 100 times more accurate than\r\na 4-Layer width-100 MLP (10−7 vs 10−5 MSE) and 100 times more parameter efficient (102 vs\r\n104 parameters). Therefore we speculate that KANs might have the potential of serving as a good\r\nneural network representation for model reduction of PDEs. However, we want to note that our\r\nimplementation of KANs are typically 10x slower than MLPs to train. The ground truth being a\r\nsymbolic formula might be an unfair comparison for MLPs since KANs are good at representing\r\nsymbolic formulas. In general, KANs and MLPs are good at representing different function classes\r\nof PDE solutions, which needs detailed future study to understand their respective boundaries.\r\n3.5 Continual Learning\r\nCatastrophic forgetting is a serious problem in current machine learning [39].

The dataset is a 1D regression task with 5 Gaussian peaks (top\r\nrow). Data around each peak is presented sequentially (instead of all at once) to KANs and MLPs.

When a new task is learned, structure re-organization\r\nonly occurs in local regions responsible for relevant skills [40, 41], leaving other regions intact. Most\r\nartificial neural networks, including MLPs, do not have this notion of locality, which is probably the\r\nreason for catastrophic forgetting.\r\nWe show that KANs have local plasticity and can avoid catastrophic forgetting by leveraging the\r\nlocality of splines. The idea is simple: since spline bases are local, a sample will only affect a\r\nfew nearby spline coefficients, leaving far-away coefficients intact (which is desirable since far\u0002away regions may have already stored information that we want to preserve). By contrast, since\r\nMLPs usually use global activations, e.g., ReLU/Tanh/SiLU etc., any local change may propagate\r\nuncontrollably to regions far away, destroying the information being stored there.\r\nWe use a toy example to validate this intuition. The 1D regression task is composed of 5 Gaussian\r\npeaks. Data around each peak is presented sequentially (instead of all at once) to KANs and MLPs,\r\nas shown in Figure 3.4 top row. KAN and MLP predictions after each training phase are shown in\r\nthe middle and bottom rows. As expected, KAN only remodels regions where data is present on\r\nin the current phase, leaving previous regions unchanged. By contrast, MLPs remodels the whole\r\nregion after seeing new data samples, leading to catastrophic forgetting.\r\nHere we simply present our preliminary results on an extremely simple example, to demonstrate\r\nhow one could possibly leverage locality in KANs (thanks to spline parametrizations) to reduce\r\ncatastrophic forgetting. However, it remains unclear whether our method can generalize to more\r\nrealistic setups, especially in high-dimensional cases where it is unclear how to define “locality”. In\r\nfuture work, We would also like to study how our method can be connected to and combined with\r\nSOTA methods in continual learning [42, 43].\r\n4 KANs are interpretable\r\nIn this section, we show that KANs are interpretable and interactive thanks to the techniques we\r\ndeveloped in Section 2.5. We want to test the use of KANs not only on synthetic tasks (Section 4.1\r\nand 4.2), but also in real-life scientific research.

KANs could potentially be the foundation model for AI + Science due\r\nto their accuracy (last section) and interpretability (this section).\r\n4.1 Supervised toy datasets\r\nWe first examine KANs’ ability to reveal the compositional structures in symbolic formulas. Six\r\nexamples are listed below and their KANs are visualized in Figure 4.1. KANs are able to reveal the\r\ncompositional structures present in these formulas, as well as learn the correct univariate functions.\r\n(a) Multiplication f(x, y) = xy. A [2, 5, 1] KAN is pruned to a [2, 2, 1] KAN. The learned acti\u0002vation functions are linear and quadratic. From the computation graph, we see that the way it\r\ncomputes xy is leveraging 2xy = (x + y)\r\n2 − (x2 + y2\r\n).\r\n(b) Division of positive numbers f(x, y) = x/y. A [2, 5, 1] KAN is pruned to a [2, 1, 1] KAN.\r\nThe learned activation functions are logarithmic and exponential functions, and the KAN is\r\ncomputing x/y by leveraging the identity x/y = exp(logx − logy).\r\n(c) Numerical to categorical. The task is to convert a real number in [0, 1] to its first decimal digit (as\r\none hots), e.g., 0.0618 → [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, · · · ], 0.314 → [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, · · · ].

In Figure 4.2, we\r\nshow that for seed = 0, KAN reveals the functional dependence among x1,x2, and x3; for another\r\nseed = 2024, KAN reveals the functional dependence between x4 and x5. Our preliminary results\r\nrely on randomness (different seeds) to discover different relations; in the future we would like to\r\ninvestigate a more systematic and more controlled way to discover a complete set of relations. Even\r\nso, our tool in its current status can provide insights for scientific tasks. We present our results with\r\nthe knot dataset in Section 4.3.\r\n4.3 Application to Mathematics: Knot Theory\r\nKnot theory is a subject in low-dimensional topology that sheds light on topological aspects of three\u0002manifolds and four-manifolds and has a variety of applications, including in biology and topological\r\nquantum computing. Mathematically, a knot K is an embedding of S\r\n1\r\ninto S\r\n3\r\n. Two knots K and\r\nK′are topologically equivalent if one can be deformed into the other via deformation of the ambient\r\nspace S\r\n3\r\n, in which case we write [K] = [K′]. Some knots are topologically trivial, meaning that\r\nthey can be smoothly deformed to a standard circle. Knots have a variety of deformation-invariant\r\nfeatures f called topological invariants, which may be used to show that two knots are topologically\r\ninequivalent, [K] ̸= [K′] if f(K) ̸= f(K′). In some cases the topological invariants are geometric\r\nin nature. For instance, a hyperbolic knot K has a knot complement S\r\n3 \\ K that admits a canonical\r\nhyperbolic metric g such that volg(K) is a topological invariant known as the hyperbolic volume.\r\nOther topological invariants are algebraic in nature, such as the Jones polynomial.\r\nGiven the fundamental nature of knots in mathematics and the importance of its applications, it is\r\ninteresting to study whether ML can lead to new results. For instance, in [45] reinforcement learning\r\nwas utilized to establish ribbonness of certain knots, which ruled out many potential counterexam\u0002ples to the smooth 4d Poincaré conjecture.\r\nSupervised learning In [44], supervised learning and human domain experts were utilized to arrive\r\nat a new theorem relating algebraic and geometric knot invariants. In this case, gradient saliency\r\nidentified key invariants for the supervised problem, which led the domain experts to make a con\u0002jecture that was subsequently refined and proven. We study whether a KAN can achieve good\r\ninterpretable results on the same problem, which predicts the signature of a knot. Their main results\r\nfrom studying the knot theory dataset are:\r\n(1) They use network attribution methods to find that the signature σ is mostly dependent on merid\u0002inal distance µ (real µr, imag µi) and longitudinal distance λ.\r\n(2) Human scientists later identified that σ has high correlation with the slope ≡ Re( λ\r\nµ\r\n) = λµr\r\nµ2\r\nr+µ2\r\ni\r\nand derived a bound for |2σ − slope|.\r\n22",

With KANs, we rediscover Deepmind’s results that signature is\r\nmainly dependent on meridinal translation (real and imaginary parts).\r\nMethod Architecture Parameter Count Accuracy\r\nDeepmind’s MLP 4 layer, width-300 3 × 105 78.0%\r\nKANs 2 layer, [17, 1, 14] (G = 3, k = 3) 2 × 102 81.6%\r\nTable 3: KANs can achieve better accuracy than MLPs with much fewer parameters in the signature classifi\u0002cation problem. Soon after our preprint was first released, Prof. Shi Lab from Georgia tech discovered that an\r\nMLP with only 60 parameters is sufficient to achieve 80% accuracy (public but unpublished results). This is\r\ngood news for AI + Science because this means perhaps many AI + Science tasks are not that computationally\r\ndemanding than we might think (either with MLPs or with KANs), hence many new scientific discoveries are\r\npossible even on personal laptops.\r\nWe show below that KANs not only rediscover these results with much smaller networks and much\r\nmore automation, but also present some interesting new results and insights.\r\nTo investigate (1), we treat 17 knot invariants as inputs and signature as outputs. Similar to the\r\nsetup in [44], signatures (which are even numbers) are encoded as one-hot vectors and networks are\r\ntrained with cross-entropy loss. We find that an extremely small [17, 1, 14] KAN is able to achieve\r\n81.6% test accuracy (while Deepmind’s 4-layer width-300 MLP achieves 78% test accuracy). The\r\n[17, 1, 14] KAN (G = 3, k = 3) has ≈ 200 parameters, while the MLP has ≈ 3 × 105 parameters,\r\nshown in Table 3. It is remarkable that KANs can be both more accurate and much more parameter\r\nefficient than MLPs at the same time. In terms of interpretability, we scale the transparency of each\r\nactivation according to its magnitude, so it becomes immediately clear which input variables are\r\nimportant without the need for feature attribution (see Figure 4.3 left): signature is mostly dependent\r\non µr, and slightly dependent on µi and λ, while dependence on other variables is small. We then\r\ntrain a [3, 1, 14] KAN on the three important variables, obtaining test accuracy 78.2%. Our results\r\nhave one subtle difference from results in [44]: they find that signature is mostly dependent on µi,\r\nwhile we find that signature is mostly dependent on µr. This difference could be due to subtle\r\nalgorithmic choices, but has led us to carry out the following experiments: (a) ablation studies. We\r\nshow that µr contributes more to accuracy than µi (see Figure 4.3): for example, µr alone can\r\nachieve 65.0% accuracy, while µi alone can only achieve 43.8% accuracy. (b) We find a symbolic\r\nformula (in Table 4) which only involves µr and λ, but can achieve 77.8% test accuracy.\r\nTo investigate (2), i.e., obtain the symbolic form of σ, we formulate the problem as a regression\r\ntask. Using auto-symbolic regression introduced in Section 2.5.1, we can convert a trained KAN\r\n23",

We train the KANs with\r\nλ = {10−2, 10−3} to favor sparse combination of inputs, and seed = {0, 1, · · · , 99}. All 200 net\u0002works can be grouped into three clusters, with representative KANs displayed in Figure 4.4. These\r\nthree groups of dependent variables are:\r\n(1) The first group of dependent variables is signature, real part of meridinal distance, and longi\u0002tudinal distance (plus two other variables which can be removed because of (3)). This is the\r\nsignature dependence studied above, so it is very interesting to see that this dependence relation\r\nis rediscovered again in the unsupervised mode.\r\n(2) The second group of variables involve cusp volume V , real part of meridinal translation µr and\r\nlongitudinal translation λ. Their activations all look like logarithmic functions (which can be\r\nverified by the implied symbolic functionality in Section 2.5.1). So the relation is − log V +\r\nlog µr + log λ = 0 which is equivalent to V = µrλ, which is true by definition. It is, however,\r\nreassuring that we discover this relation without any prior knowledge.\r\n(3) The third group of variables includes the real part of short geodesic gr and injectivity radius.\r\nTheir activations look qualitatively the same but differ by a minus sign, so it is conjectured that\r\nthese two variables have a linear correlation. We plot 2D scatters, finding that 2r upper bounds\r\ngr, which is also a well-known relation [46].\r\nIt is interesting that KANs’ unsupervised mode can rediscover several known mathematical rela\u0002tions. The good news is that the results discovered by KANs are probably reliable; the bad news\r\nis that we have not discovered anything new yet. It is worth noting that we have chosen a shallow\r\nKAN for simple visualization, but deeper KANs can probably find more relations if they exist.

            "content": "4.4 Application to Physics: Anderson localization\r\nAnderson localization is the fundamental phenomenon in which disorder in a quantum system leads\r\nto the localization of electronic wave functions, causing all transport to be ceased [47]. In one and\r\ntwo dimensions, scaling arguments show that all electronic eigenstates are exponentially localized\r\nfor an infinitesimal amount of random disorder [48, 49]. In contrast, in three dimensions, a critical\r\nenergy forms a phase boundary that separates the extended states from the localized states, known\r\nas a mobility edge. The understanding of these mobility edges is crucial for explaining various\r\nfundamental phenomena such as the metal-insulator transition in solids [50], as well as localization\r\neffects of light in photonic devices [51, 52, 53, 54, 55]. It is therefore necessary to develop micro\u0002scopic models that exhibit mobility edges to enable detailed investigations. Developing such models\r\nis often more practical in lower dimensions, where introducing quasiperiodicity instead of random\r\ndisorder can also result in mobility edges that separate localized and extended phases. Furthermore,\r\nexperimental realizations of analytical mobility edges can help resolve the debate on localization in\r\ninteracting systems [56, 57]. Indeed, several recent studies have focused on identifying such models\r\nand deriving exact analytic expressions for their mobility edges [58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64].\r\nHere, we apply KANs to numerical data generated from quasiperiodic tight-binding models to ex\u0002tract their mobility edges. In particular, we examine three classes of models: the Mosaic model\r\n(MM) [62], the generalized Aubry-André model (GAAM) [61] and the modified Aubry-André\r\nmodel (MAAM) [59]. For the MM, we testify KAN’s ability to accurately extract mobility edge\r\nas a 1D function of energy. For the GAAM, we find that the formula obtained from a KAN closely\r\nmatches the ground truth. For the more complicated MAAM, we demonstrate yet another exam\u0002ple of the symbolic interpretability of this framework. A user can simplify the complex expression\r\nobtained from KANs (and corresponding symbolic formulas) by means of a “collaboration” where\r\nthe human generates hypotheses to obtain a better match (e.g., making an assumption of the form of\r\ncertain activation function), after which KANs can carry out quick hypotheses testing.\r\nTo quantify the localization of states in these models, the inverse participation ratio (IPR) is com\u0002monly used. The IPR for the k\r\nth eigenstate, ψ(k)\r\n, is given by\r\nIPRk =\r\nP\r\nn\r\n|ψ\r\n(k)\r\nn |\r\n4\r\n\u0010P\r\nn\r\n|ψ\r\n(k)\r\nn |\r\n2\r\n\u00112\r\n(4.2)\r\nwhere the sum runs over the site index. Here, we use the related measure of localization – the fractal\r\ndimension of the states, given by\r\nDk = −\r\nlog(IPRk)\r\nlog(N)\r\n(4.3)\r\nwhere N is the system size. Dk = 0(1) indicates localized (extended) states.\r\nMosaic Model (MM) We first consider a class of tight-binding models defined by the Hamilto\u0002nian [62]\r\nH = t\r\nX\r\nn\r\n\u0010\r\nc\r\n†\r\nn+1cn + H.c.\u0011\r\n+\r\nX\r\nn\r\nVn(λ, ϕ)c\r\n†\r\nn\r\ncn, (4.4)\r\n26",

The energy\r\n(E) spectrum for this model generically contains extended and localized regimes separated by a\r\nmobility edge. Interestingly, a unique feature found here is that the mobility edges are present for an\r\narbitrarily strong quasiperiodic potential (i.e. there are always extended states present in the system\r\nthat co-exist with localized ones).\r\nThe mobility edge can be described by g(λ, E) ≡ λ − |fκ(E)| = 0. g(λ, E) > 0 and g(λ, E) <\r\n0 correspond to localized and extended phases, respectively. Learning the mobility edge therefore\r\nhinges on learning the “order parameter” g(λ, E). Admittedly, this problem can be tackled by many\r\nother theoretical methods for this class of models [62], but we will demonstrate below that our KAN\r\nframework is ready and convenient to take in assumptions and inductive biases from human users.\r\nLet us assume a hypothetical user Alice, who is a new PhD student in condensed matter physics,\r\nand she is provided with a [2, 1] KAN as an assistant for the task. Firstly, she understands that\r\nthis is a classification task, so it is wise to set the activation function in the second layer to be\r\nsigmoid by using the fix_symbolic functionality. Secondly, she realizes that learning the whole\r\n2D function g(λ, E) is unnecessary because in the end she only cares about λ = λ(E) determined\r\nby g(λ, E) = 0. In so doing, it is reasonable to assume g(λ, E) = λ − h(E) = 0. Alice simply sets\r\nthe activation function of λ to be linear by again using the fix_symbolic functionality. Now Alice\r\ntrains the KAN network and conveniently obtains the mobility edge, as shown in Figure 4.5. Alice\r\ncan get both intuitive qualitative understanding (bottom) and quantitative results (middle), which\r\nwell match the ground truth (top).\r\n27",

After that, she immediately gets a\r\nnetwork which is already symbolic (shown in Figure 4.6 (a) step 2), with comparable (even slightly\r\nbetter) accuracy 98.9%. By using symbolic_formula functionality, Alice conveniently gets the\r\nsymbolic form of g, shown in Table 5 GAAM-KAN auto (row three). Perhaps she wants to cross out\r\nsome small terms and snap coefficient to small integers, which takes her close to the true answer.\r\nThis hypothetical story for Alice would be completely different if she is using a symbolic regres\u0002sion method. If she is lucky, SR can return the exact correct formula. However, the vast majority\r\nof the time SR does not return useful results and it is impossible for Alice to “debug” or inter\u0002act with the underlying process of symbolic regression. Furthermore, Alice may feel uncomfort\u0002able/inexperienced to provide a library of symbolic terms as prior knowledge to SR before SR is\r\nrun. By constrast in KANs, Alice does not need to put any prior information to KANs. She can first\r\nget some clues by staring at a trained KAN and only then it is her job to decide which hypothesis\r\nshe wants to make (e.g., “all activations are linear or quadratic”) and implement her hypothesis in\r\nKANs. Although it is not likely for KANs to return the correct answer immediately, KANs will\r\nalways return something useful, and Alice can collaborate with it to refine the results.\r\nModified Andre-Aubry Model (MAAM) The last class of models we consider is defined by the\r\nHamiltonian [59]\r\nH =\r\nX\r\nn̸=n′\r\nte−p|n−n\r\n′\r\n|\r\n\r\nc\r\n†\r\nn\r\ncn′ + H.c.\u0001\r\n+\r\nX\r\nn\r\nVn(λ, ϕ)c\r\n†\r\nn\r\ncn, (4.9)\r\nwhere t is the strength of the exponentially decaying coupling in space, cn(c\r\n†\r\nn\r\n) is the annihilation\r\n(creation) operator at site n and the potential energy Vn is given by\r\nVn(λ, ϕ) = λ cos(2πnb + ϕ), (4.10)\r\nAs before, to introduce quasiperiodicity, we set b to be irrational (the golden ratio). For these models,\r\nthe mobility edge is given by the closed form expression [59],\r\nλ cosh(p) = E + t = E + t1exp(p) (4.11)\r\nwhere we define t1 ≡ texp(−p) as the nearest neighbor hopping strength, and we set t1 = 1 below.\r\nLet us assume Alice wants to figure out the mobility edge for MAAM. This task is more complicated\r\nand requires more human wisdom. As in the last example, Alice starts from a [4, 2, 1, 1] KAN and\r\ntrains it but gets an accuracy around 75% which is less than acceptable. She then chooses a larger\r\n[4, 3, 1, 1] KAN and successfully gets 98.4% which is acceptable (Figure 4.6 (b) step 1). Alice\r\nnotices that ϕ is not picked up on by KANs, which means that the mobility edge is independent of\r\nthe phase factor ϕ (agreeing with Eq. (4.11)). If Alice turns on the automatic symbolic regression\r\n(using a large library consisting of exp, tanh etc.), she would get a complicated formula in Tabel 5-\r\nMAAM-KAN auto, which has 97.1% accuracy. However, if Alice wants to find a simpler symbolic\r\nformula, she will want to use the manual mode where she does the symbolic snapping by herself.\r\nBefore that she finds that the [4, 3, 1, 1] KAN after training can then be pruned to be [4, 2, 1, 1], while\r\nmaintaining 97.7% accuracy (Figure 4.6 (b)). Alice may think that all activation functions except\r\nthose dependent on p are linear or quadratic and snap them to be either linear or quadratic manually\r\nby using fix_symbolic. After snapping and retraining, the updated KAN is shown in Figure 4.6 (c)\r\nstep 3, maintaining 97.7% accuracy. From now on, Alice may make two different choices based on\r\nher prior knowledge. In one case, Alice may have guessed that the dependence on p is cosh, so she\r\nsets the activations of p to be cosh function. She retrains KAN and gets 96.9% accuracy (Figure 4.6\r\n(c) Step 4A). In another case, Alice does not know the cosh p dependence, so she pursues simplicity\r\n29",

            "content": "snapping, constraining the library to be only linear or quadratic. After that, she immediately gets a\r\nnetwork which is already symbolic (shown in Figure 4.6 (a) step 2), with comparable (even slightly\r\nbetter) accuracy 98.9%. By using symbolic_formula functionality, Alice conveniently gets the\r\nsymbolic form of g, shown in Table 5 GAAM-KAN auto (row three). Perhaps she wants to cross out\r\nsome small terms and snap coefficient to small integers, which takes her close to the true answer.\r\nThis hypothetical story for Alice would be completely different if she is using a symbolic regres\u0002sion method. If she is lucky, SR can return the exact correct formula. However, the vast majority\r\nof the time SR does not return useful results and it is impossible for Alice to “debug” or inter\u0002act with the underlying process of symbolic regression. Furthermore, Alice may feel uncomfort\u0002able/inexperienced to provide a library of symbolic terms as prior knowledge to SR before SR is\r\nrun. By constrast in KANs, Alice does not need to put any prior information to KANs. She can first\r\nget some clues by staring at a trained KAN and only then it is her job to decide which hypothesis\r\nshe wants to make (e.g., “all activations are linear or quadratic”) and implement her hypothesis in\r\nKANs. Although it is not likely for KANs to return the correct answer immediately, KANs will\r\nalways return something useful, and Alice can collaborate with it to refine the results.\r\nModified Andre-Aubry Model (MAAM) The last class of models we consider is defined by the\r\nHamiltonian [59]\r\nH =\r\nX\r\nn̸=n′\r\nte−p|n−n\r\n′\r\n|\r\n\r\nc\r\n†\r\nn\r\ncn′ + H.c.\u0001\r\n+\r\nX\r\nn\r\nVn(λ, ϕ)c\r\n†\r\nn\r\ncn, (4.9)\r\nwhere t is the strength of the exponentially decaying coupling in space, cn(c\r\n†\r\nn\r\n) is the annihilation\r\n(creation) operator at site n and the potential energy Vn is given by\r\nVn(λ, ϕ) = λ cos(2πnb + ϕ), (4.10)\r\nAs before, to introduce quasiperiodicity, we set b to be irrational (the golden ratio). For these models,\r\nthe mobility edge is given by the closed form expression [59],\r\nλ cosh(p) = E + t = E + t1exp(p) (4.11)\r\nwhere we define t1 ≡ texp(−p) as the nearest neighbor hopping strength, and we set t1 = 1 below.\r\nLet us assume Alice wants to figure out the mobility edge for MAAM. This task is more complicated\r\nand requires more human wisdom. As in the last example, Alice starts from a [4, 2, 1, 1] KAN and\r\ntrains it but gets an accuracy around 75% which is less than acceptable. She then chooses a larger\r\n[4, 3, 1, 1] KAN and successfully gets 98.4% which is acceptable (Figure 4.6 (b) step 1). Alice\r\nnotices that ϕ is not picked up on by KANs, which means that the mobility edge is independent of\r\nthe phase factor ϕ (agreeing with Eq. (4.11)). If Alice turns on the automatic symbolic regression\r\n(using a large library consisting of exp, tanh etc.), she would get a complicated formula in Tabel 5-\r\nMAAM-KAN auto, which has 97.1% accuracy. However, if Alice wants to find a simpler symbolic\r\nformula, she will want to use the manual mode where she does the symbolic snapping by herself.\r\nBefore that she finds that the [4, 3, 1, 1] KAN after training can then be pruned to be [4, 2, 1, 1], while\r\nmaintaining 97.7% accuracy (Figure 4.6 (b)). Alice may think that all activation functions except\r\nthose dependent on p are linear or quadratic and snap them to be either linear or quadratic manually\r\nby using fix_symbolic. After snapping and retraining, the updated KAN is shown in Figure 4.6 (c)\r\nstep 3, maintaining 97.7% accuracy. From now on, Alice may make two different choices based on\r\nher prior knowledge. In one case, Alice may have guessed that the dependence on p is cosh, so she\r\nsets the activations of p to be cosh function. She retrains KAN and gets 96.9% accuracy (Figure 4.6\r\n(c) Step 4A). In another case, Alice does not know the cosh p dependence, so she pursues simplicity\r\n29",

If she tried both, she would realize that cosh is better in terms of accuracy,\r\nwhile quadratic is better in terms of simplicity. The formulas corresponding to these steps are listed\r\nin Table 5. It is clear that the more manual operations are done by Alice, the simpler the symbolic\r\nformula is (which slight sacrifice in accuracy).

The connection between the Kolmogorov\u0002Arnold theorem (KAT) and neural networks is not new in the literature [65, 66, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,\r\n14, 67, 68], but the pathological behavior of inner functions makes KAT appear unpromising in\r\npractice [65]. Most of these prior works stick to the original 2-layer width-(2n+ 1) networks, which\r\nwere limited in expressive power and many of them are even predating back-propagation. Therefore,\r\nmost studies were built on theories with rather limited or artificial toy experiments. More broadly\r\nspeaking, KANs are also somewhat related to generalized additive models (GAMs) [69], graph\r\nneural networks [70] and kernel machines [71]. The connections are intriguing and fundamental but\r\nmight be out of the scope of the current paper. Our contribution lies in generalizing the Kolmogorov\r\nnetwork to arbitrary widths and depths, revitalizing and contexualizing them in today’s deep learning\r\nstream, as well as highlighting its potential role as a foundation model for AI + Science.\r\nNeural Scaling Laws (NSLs). NSLs are the phenomena where test losses behave as power laws\r\nagainst model size, data, compute etc [72, 73, 74, 75, 23, 76, 77, 78]. The origin of NSLs still\r\n30",

            "content": "Mathematical aspects: Although we have presented preliminary mathematical analysis of KANs\r\n(Theorem 2.1), our mathematical understanding of them is still very limited. The Kolmogorov\u0002Arnold representation theorem has been studied thoroughly in mathematics, but the theorem corre\u0002sponds to KANs with shape [n, 2n + 1, 1], which is a very restricted subclass of KANs. Does our\r\nempirical success with deeper KANs imply something fundamental in mathematics? An appeal\u0002ing generalized Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem could define “deeper” Kolmogorov-Arnold represen\u0002tations beyond depth-2 compositions, and potentially relate smoothness of activation functions to\r\ndepth. Hypothetically, there exist functions which cannot be represented smoothly in the original\r\n(depth-2) Kolmogorov-Arnold representations, but might be smoothly represented with depth-3 or\r\nbeyond. Can we use this notion of “Kolmogorov-Arnold depth” to characterize function classes?\r\nAlgorithmic aspects: We discuss the following:\r\n(1) Accuracy. Multiple choices in architecture design and training are not fully investigated so\r\nalternatives can potentially further improve accuracy. For example, spline activation functions\r\nmight be replaced by radial basis functions or other local kernels. Adaptive grid strategies can\r\nbe used.\r\n(2) Efficiency. One major reason why KANs run slowly is because different activation functions\r\ncannot leverage batch computation (large data through the same function). Actually, one can\r\ninterpolate between activation functions being all the same (MLPs) and all different (KANs),\r\nby grouping activation functions into multiple groups (“multi-head”), where members within a\r\ngroup share the same activation function.\r\n(3) Hybrid of KANs and MLPs. KANs have two major differences compared to MLPs:\r\n(i) activation functions are on edges instead of on nodes,\r\n(ii) activation functions are learnable instead of fixed.\r\nWhich change is more essential to explain KAN’s advantage? We present our preliminary results\r\nin Appendix B where we study a model which has (ii), i.e., activation functions are learnable\r\n(like KANs), but not (i), i.e., activation functions are on nodes (like MLPs). Moreover, one can\r\nalso construct another model with fixed activations (like MLPs) but on edges (like KANs).\r\n(4) Adaptivity. Thanks to the intrinsic locality of spline basis functions, we can introduce adap\u0002tivity in the design and training of KANs to enhance both accuracy and efficiency: see the\r\nidea of multi-level training like multigrid methods as in [114, 115], or domain-dependent basis\r\nfunctions like multiscale methods as in [116].\r\nApplication aspects: We have presented some preliminary evidences that KANs are more effective\r\nthan MLPs in science-related tasks, e.g., fitting physical equations and PDE solving. We would like\r\nto apply KANs to solve Navier-Stokes equations, density functional theory, or any other tasks that\r\ncan be formulated as regression or PDE solving. We would also like to apply KANs to machine\u0002learning-related tasks, which would require integrating KANs into current architectures, e.g., trans\u0002formers – one may propose “kansformers” which replace MLPs by KANs in transformers.\r\nKAN as a “language model” for AI + Science The reason why large language models are so\r\ntransformative is because they are useful to anyone who can speak natural language. The language\r\nof science is functions. KANs are composed of interpretable functions, so when a human user stares\r\nat a KAN, it is like communicating with it using the language of functions. This paragraph aims\r\nto promote the AI-Scientist-Collaboration paradigm rather than our specific tool KANs.

            "content": "Mathematical aspects: Although we have presented preliminary mathematical analysis of KANs\r\n(Theorem 2.1), our mathematical understanding of them is still very limited. The Kolmogorov\u0002Arnold representation theorem has been studied thoroughly in mathematics, but the theorem corre\u0002sponds to KANs with shape [n, 2n + 1, 1], which is a very restricted subclass of KANs. Does our\r\nempirical success with deeper KANs imply something fundamental in mathematics? An appeal\u0002ing generalized Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem could define “deeper” Kolmogorov-Arnold represen\u0002tations beyond depth-2 compositions, and potentially relate smoothness of activation functions to\r\ndepth. Hypothetically, there exist functions which cannot be represented smoothly in the original\r\n(depth-2) Kolmogorov-Arnold representations, but might be smoothly represented with depth-3 or\r\nbeyond. Can we use this notion of “Kolmogorov-Arnold depth” to characterize function classes?\r\nAlgorithmic aspects: We discuss the following:\r\n(1) Accuracy. Multiple choices in architecture design and training are not fully investigated so\r\nalternatives can potentially further improve accuracy. For example, spline activation functions\r\nmight be replaced by radial basis functions or other local kernels. Adaptive grid strategies can\r\nbe used.\r\n(2) Efficiency. One major reason why KANs run slowly is because different activation functions\r\ncannot leverage batch computation (large data through the same function). Actually, one can\r\ninterpolate between activation functions being all the same (MLPs) and all different (KANs),\r\nby grouping activation functions into multiple groups (“multi-head”), where members within a\r\ngroup share the same activation function.\r\n(3) Hybrid of KANs and MLPs. KANs have two major differences compared to MLPs:\r\n(i) activation functions are on edges instead of on nodes,\r\n(ii) activation functions are learnable instead of fixed.\r\nWhich change is more essential to explain KAN’s advantage? We present our preliminary results\r\nin Appendix B where we study a model which has (ii), i.e., activation functions are learnable\r\n(like KANs), but not (i), i.e., activation functions are on nodes (like MLPs). Moreover, one can\r\nalso construct another model with fixed activations (like MLPs) but on edges (like KANs).\r\n(4) Adaptivity. Thanks to the intrinsic locality of spline basis functions, we can introduce adap\u0002tivity in the design and training of KANs to enhance both accuracy and efficiency: see the\r\nidea of multi-level training like multigrid methods as in [114, 115], or domain-dependent basis\r\nfunctions like multiscale methods as in [116].\r\nApplication aspects: We have presented some preliminary evidences that KANs are more effective\r\nthan MLPs in science-related tasks, e.g., fitting physical equations and PDE solving. We would like\r\nto apply KANs to solve Navier-Stokes equations, density functional theory, or any other tasks that\r\ncan be formulated as regression or PDE solving. We would also like to apply KANs to machine\u0002learning-related tasks, which would require integrating KANs into current architectures, e.g., trans\u0002formers – one may propose “kansformers” which replace MLPs by KANs in transformers.\r\nKAN as a “language model” for AI + Science The reason why large language models are so\r\ntransformative is because they are useful to anyone who can speak natural language. The language\r\nof science is functions. KANs are composed of interpretable functions, so when a human user stares\r\nat a KAN, it is like communicating with it using the language of functions. This paragraph aims\r\nto promote the AI-Scientist-Collaboration paradigm rather than our specific tool KANs. Just like\r\npeople use different languages to communicate, we expect that in the future KANs will be just one\r\n32",

            "content": "Figure 6.1: Should I use KANs or MLPs?\r\nof the languages for AI + Science, although KANs will be one of the very first languages that would\r\nenable AI and human to communicate. However, enabled by KANs, the AI-Scientist-Collaboration\r\nparadigm has never been this easy and convenient, which leads us to rethink the paradigm of how\r\nwe want to approach AI + Science: Do we want AI scientists, or do we want AI that helps scientists?\r\nThe intrinsic difficulty of (fully automated) AI scientists is that it is hard to make human preferences\r\nquantitative, which would codify human preferences into AI objectives. In fact, scientists in different\r\nfields may feel differently about which functions are simple or interpretable. As a result, it is more\r\ndesirable for scientists to have an AI that can speak the scientific language (functions) and can\r\nconveniently interact with inductive biases of individual scientist(s) to adapt to a specific scientific\r\ndomain.\r\nFinal takeaway: Should I use KANs or MLPs?\r\nCurrently, the biggest bottleneck of KANs lies in its slow training. KANs are usually 10x slower\r\nthan MLPs, given the same number of parameters. We should be honest that we did not try hard\r\nto optimize KANs’ efficiency though, so we deem KANs’ slow training more as an engineering\r\nproblem to be improved in the future rather than a fundamental limitation. If one wants to train a\r\nmodel fast, one should use MLPs. In other cases, however, KANs should be comparable or better\r\nthan MLPs, which makes them worth trying. The decision tree in Figure 6.1 can help decide when\r\nto use a KAN. In short, if you care about interpretability and/or accuracy, and slow training is not a\r\nmajor concern, we suggest trying KANs, at least for small-scale AI + Science problems.\r\nAcknowledgement\r\nWe would like to thank Mikail Khona, Tomaso Poggio, Pingchuan Ma, Rui Wang, Di Luo, Sara\r\nBeery, Catherine Liang, Yiping Lu, Nicholas H.

KANs have two main\r\nchanges to standard MLPs: (1) the activation functions become learnable rather than being fixed;\r\n(2) the activation functions are placed on edges rather than nodes. To disentangle these two factors,\r\nwe also propose learnable activation networks (LAN) which only has learnable activations but still\r\non nodes, illustrated in Figure B.1.\r\nFor a LAN with width N, depth L, and grid point number G, the number of parameters is N2L +\r\nNLG where N2L is the number of parameters for weight matrices and NLG is the number of\r\nparameters for spline activations, which causes little overhead in addition to MLP since usually\r\nG ≪ N so NLG ≪ N2L. LANs are similar to MLPs so they can be initialized from pretrained\r\nMLPs and fine-tuned by allowing learnable activation functions. An example is to use LAN to\r\nimprove SIREN, presented in Section B.3.\r\nComparison of LAN and KAN. Pros of LANs:\r\n(1) LANs are conceptually simpler than KANs. They are closer to standard MLPs (the only change\r\nis that activation functions become learnable).\r\n(2) LANs scale better than KANs. LANs/KANs have learnable activation functions on nodes/edges,\r\nrespectively. So activation parameters in LANs/KANs scale as N/N2, where N is model width.\r\nCons of LANs:\r\n(1) LANs seem to be less interpretable (weight matrices are hard to interpret, just like in MLPs);\r\n(2) LANs also seem to be less accurate than KANs, but still more accurate than MLPs. Like KANs,\r\nLANs also admit grid extension if theLANs’ activation functions are parametrized by splines.\r\nB.2 LAN interpretability results\r\nWe present preliminary interpretabilty results of LANs in Figure B.2. With the same examples in\r\nFigure 4.1 for which KANs are perfectly interpretable, LANs seem much less interpretable due to\r\n42",

LANs do not appear to be very interpretable. We conjecture that the\r\nweight matrices leave too many degree of freedoms.\r\nthe existence of weight matrices. First, weight matrices are less readily interpretable than learn\u0002able activation functions. Second, weight matrices bring in too many degrees of freedom, making\r\nlearnable activation functions too unconstrained. Our preliminary results with LANs seem to imply\r\nthat getting rid of linear weight matrices (by having learnable activations on edges, like KANs) is\r\nnecessary for interpretability.\r\nB.3 Fitting Images (LAN)\r\nImplicit neural representations view images as 2D functions f(x, y), where the pixel value f is a\r\nfunction of two coordinates of the pixel x and y. To compress an image, such an implicit neu\u0002ral representation (f is a neural network) can achieve impressive compression of parameters while\r\nmaintaining almost original image quality. SIREN [117] proposed to use MLPs with periodic acti\u0002vation functions to fit the function f. It is natural to consider other activation functions, which are\r\nallowed in LANs. However, since we initialize LAN activations to be smooth but SIREN requires\r\nhigh-frequency features, LAN does not work immediately. Note that each activation function in\r\nLANs is a sum of the base function and the spline function, i.e., ϕ(x) = b(x) + spline(x), we set\r\n43",

For both MLP\r\nand LAN, the shape is [2,128,128,128,128,128,1]. We train them with the Adam optimizer, batch\r\nsize 4096, for 5000 steps with learning rate 10−3and 5000 steps with learning rate 10−4. As shown\r\nin Figure B.3, the LAN (orange) can achieve higher PSNR than the MLP (blue) due to the LAN’s\r\nflexibility to fine tune activation functions. We show that it is also possible to initialize a LAN from\r\nan MLP and further fine tune the LAN (green) for better PSNR. We have chosen G = 5 in our\r\nexperiments, so the additional parameter increase is roughly G/N = 5/128 ≈ 4% over the original\r\nparameters.\r\nC Dependence on hyperparameters\r\nWe show the effects of hyperparamters on the f(x, y) = exp(sin(πx) + y\r\n2\r\n) case in Figure C.1. To\r\nget an interpretable graph, we want the number of active activation functions to be as small (ideally\r\n3) as possible.\r\n(1) We need entropy penalty to reduce the number of active activation functions. Without entropy\r\npenalty, there are many duplicate functions.\r\n(2) Results can depend on random seeds. With some unlucky seed, the pruned network could be\r\nlarger than needed.\r\n(3) The overall penalty strength λ effectively controls the sparsity.\r\n(4) The grid number G also has a subtle effect on interpretability. When G is too small, because\r\neach one of activation function is not very expressive, the network tends to use the ensembling\r\nstrategy, making interpretation harder.\r\n(5) The piecewise polynomial order k only has a subtle effect on interpretability.
