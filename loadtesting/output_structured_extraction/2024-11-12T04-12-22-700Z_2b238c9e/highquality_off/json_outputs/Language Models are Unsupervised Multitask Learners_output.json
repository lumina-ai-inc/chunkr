Since language has a natural sequential or\u0002dering, it is common to factorize the joint probabilities over\r\nsymbols as the product of conditional probabilities (Jelinek\r\n& Mercer, 1980) (Bengio et al., 2003):\r\np(x) = Yn\r\ni=1\r\np(sn|s1, ..., sn−1) (1)\r\nThis approach allows for tractable sampling from and es\u0002timation of p(x) as well as any conditionals of the form\r\np(sn−k, ..., sn|s1, ..., sn−k−1). In recent years, there have\r\nbeen significant improvements in the expressiveness of mod\u0002els that can compute these conditional probabilities, such as\r\nself-attention architectures like the Transformer (Vaswani\r\net al., 2017).\r\nLearning to perform a single task can be expressed in a\r\nprobabilistic framework as estimating a conditional distri\u0002bution p(output|input). Since a general system should be\r\nable to perform many different tasks, even for the same\r\ninput, it should condition not only on the input but also\r\non the task to be performed. That is, it should model\r\np(output|input, task). This has been variously formalized\r\nin multitask and meta-learning settings. Task conditioning\r\nis often implemented at an architectural level, such as the\r\ntask specific encoders and decoders in (Kaiser et al., 2017)\r\nor at an algorithmic level such as the inner and outer loop\r\noptimization framework of MAML (Finn et al., 2017).

Input Representation\r\nA general language model (LM) should be able to compute\r\nthe probability of (and also generate) any string. Current\r\nlarge scale LMs include pre-processing steps such as lower\u0002casing, tokenization, and out-of-vocabulary tokens which\r\nrestrict the space of model-able strings. While processing\r\nUnicode strings as a sequence of UTF-8 bytes elegantly ful\u0002fills this requirement as exemplified in work such as Gillick\r\net al. (2015), current byte-level LMs are not competitive\r\nwith word-level LMs on large scale datasets such as the\r\nOne Billion Word Benchmark (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). We\r\nobserved a similar performance gap in our own attempts to\r\ntrain standard byte-level LMs on WebText.\r\nByte Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2015) is a\r\npractical middle ground between character and word level\r\nlanguage modeling which effectively interpolates between\r\nword level inputs for frequent symbol sequences and char\u0002acter level inputs for infrequent symbol sequences. Despite\r\nits name, reference BPE implementations often operate on\r\nUnicode code points and not byte sequences. These imple\u0002mentations would require including the full space of Uni\u0002code symbols in order to model all Unicode strings. This\r\nwould result in a base vocabulary of over 130,000 before\r\nany multi-symbol tokens are added. This is prohibitively\r\nlarge compared to the 32,000 to 64,000 token vocabularies\r\noften used with BPE. In contrast, a byte-level version of\r\nBPE only requires a base vocabulary of size 256. However,\r\ndirectly applying BPE to the byte sequence results in sub\u0002optimal merges due to BPE using a greedy frequency based\r\nheuristic for building the token vocabulary. We observed\r\nBPE including many versions of common words like dog\r\nsince they occur in many variations such as dog. dog!\r\ndog? . This results in a sub-optimal allocation of limited\r\nvocabulary slots and model capacity. To avoid this, we pre\u0002vent BPE from merging across character categories for any\r\nbyte sequence. We add an exception for spaces which sig\u0002nificantly improves the compression efficiency while adding\r\nonly minimal fragmentation of words across multiple vocab\r\ntokens.\r\nThis input representation allows us to combine the empirical\r\nbenefits of word-level LMs with the generality of byte-level\r\napproaches. Since our approach can assign a probability to\r\nany Unicode string, this allows us to evaluate our LMs on\r\nany dataset regardless of pre-processing, tokenization, or\r\nvocab size.\r\n2.3. Model\r\nWe use a Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based archi\u0002tecture for our LMs. The model largely follows the details\r\nof the OpenAI GPT model (Radford et al., 2018) with a\r\nParameters Layers dmodel\r\n117M 12 768\r\n345M 24 1024\r\n762M 36 1280\r\n1542M 48 1600\r\nTable 2. Architecture hyperparameters for the 4 model sizes.\r\nfew modifications. Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016)\r\nwas moved to the input of each sub-block, similar to a\r\npre-activation residual network (He et al., 2016) and an\r\nadditional layer normalization was added after the final self\u0002attention block. A modified initialization which accounts\r\nfor the accumulation on the residual path with model depth\r\nis used. We scale the weights of residual layers at initial\u0002ization by a factor of 1/\r\n√\r\nN where N is the number of\r\nresidual layers. The vocabulary is expanded to 50,257. We\r\nalso increase the context size from 512 to 1024 tokens and\r\na larger batchsize of 512 is used.\r\n3. Experiments\r\nWe trained and benchmarked four LMs with approximately\r\nlog-uniformly spaced sizes. The architectures are summa\u0002rized in Table 2. The smallest model is equivalent to the\r\noriginal GPT, and the second smallest equivalent to the\r\nlargest model from BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). Our largest\r\nmodel, which we call GPT-2, has over an order of magni\u0002tude more parameters than GPT. The learning rate of each\r\nmodel was manually tuned for the best perplexity on a 5%\r\nheld-out sample of WebText. All models still underfit Web\u0002Text and held-out perplexity has as of yet improved given\r\nmore training time.\r\n3.1. Language Modeling\r\nAs an initial step towards zero-shot task transfer, we are\r\ninterested in understanding how WebText LM’s perform\r\nat zero-shot domain transfer on the primary task they are\r\ntrained for – language modeling. Since our model operates\r\non a byte level and does not require lossy pre-processing\r\nor tokenization, we can evaluate it on any language model\r\nbenchmark. Results on language modeling datasets are\r\ncommonly reported in a quantity which is a scaled or ex\u0002ponentiated version of the average negative log probability\r\nper canonical prediction unit - usually a character, a byte, or\r\na word. We evaluate the same quantity by computing the\r\nlog-probability of a dataset according to a WebText LM and\r\ndividing by the number of canonical units. For many of these\r\ndatasets, WebText LMs would be tested significantly out\u0002of-distribution, having to predict aggressively standardized\r\ntext, tokenization artifacts such as disconnected punctuation\r\nand contractions, shuffled sentences, and even the string",

Model\r\nWe use a Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) based archi\u0002tecture for our LMs. The model largely follows the details\r\nof the OpenAI GPT model (Radford et al., 2018) with a\r\nParameters Layers dmodel\r\n117M 12 768\r\n345M 24 1024\r\n762M 36 1280\r\n1542M 48 1600\r\nTable 2. Architecture hyperparameters for the 4 model sizes.\r\nfew modifications. Layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016)\r\nwas moved to the input of each sub-block, similar to a\r\npre-activation residual network (He et al., 2016) and an\r\nadditional layer normalization was added after the final self\u0002attention block. A modified initialization which accounts\r\nfor the accumulation on the residual path with model depth\r\nis used. We scale the weights of residual layers at initial\u0002ization by a factor of 1/\r\n√\r\nN where N is the number of\r\nresidual layers. The vocabulary is expanded to 50,257. We\r\nalso increase the context size from 512 to 1024 tokens and\r\na larger batchsize of 512 is used.\r\n3. Experiments\r\nWe trained and benchmarked four LMs with approximately\r\nlog-uniformly spaced sizes. The architectures are summa\u0002rized in Table 2. The smallest model is equivalent to the\r\noriginal GPT, and the second smallest equivalent to the\r\nlargest model from BERT (Devlin et al., 2018). Our largest\r\nmodel, which we call GPT-2, has over an order of magni\u0002tude more parameters than GPT. The learning rate of each\r\nmodel was manually tuned for the best perplexity on a 5%\r\nheld-out sample of WebText. All models still underfit Web\u0002Text and held-out perplexity has as of yet improved given\r\nmore training time.\r\n3.1. Language Modeling\r\nAs an initial step towards zero-shot task transfer, we are\r\ninterested in understanding how WebText LM’s perform\r\nat zero-shot domain transfer on the primary task they are\r\ntrained for – language modeling. Since our model operates\r\non a byte level and does not require lossy pre-processing\r\nor tokenization, we can evaluate it on any language model\r\nbenchmark. Results on language modeling datasets are\r\ncommonly reported in a quantity which is a scaled or ex\u0002ponentiated version of the average negative log probability\r\nper canonical prediction unit - usually a character, a byte, or\r\na word. We evaluate the same quantity by computing the\r\nlog-probability of a dataset according to a WebText LM and\r\ndividing by the number of canonical units. For many of these\r\ndatasets, WebText LMs would be tested significantly out\u0002of-distribution, having to predict aggressively standardized\r\ntext, tokenization artifacts such as disconnected punctuation\r\nand contractions, shuffled sentences, and even the string",

Adding a stop-word filter as an\r\napproximation to this further increases accuracy to 63.24%,\r\nimproving the overall state of the art on this task by 4%. The\r\nprevious state of the art (Hoang et al., 2018) used a different\r\nrestricted prediction setting where the outputs of the model\r\nwere constrained to only words that appeared in the context.\r\nFor GPT-2, this restriction is harmful rather than helpful",

Recently Trinh & Le (2018)\r\ndemonstrated significant progress on this challenge using\r\nLMs, by predicting the resolution of the ambiguity with\r\nhigher probability. We follow their problem formulation and\r\nvisualize the performance of our models with both full and\r\npartial scoring techniques in Figure 3. GPT-2 improves state\r\nof the art accuracy by 7%, achieving 70.70%. The dataset\r\nis quite small with only 273 examples so we recommend\r\nreading Trichelair et al. (2018) to help contextualize this\r\nresult.\r\n3.5. Reading Comprehension\r\nThe Conversation Question Answering dataset (CoQA)\r\nReddy et al. (2018) consists of documents from 7 different\r\ndomains paired with natural language dialogues between a\r\nquestion asker and a question answerer about the document.\r\nCoQA tests reading comprehension capabilities and also\r\nthe ability of models to answer questions that depend on\r\nconversation history (such as “Why?”).\r\nGreedy decoding from GPT-2 when conditioned on a doc\u0002ument, the history of the associated conversation, and a\r\nfinal token A: achieves 55 F1 on the development set. This\r\nmatches or exceeds the performance of 3 out of 4 base\u0002line systems without using the 127,000+ manually collected\r\nquestion answer pairs those baselines were trained on. The\r\nsupervised SOTA, a BERT based system (Devlin et al.,\r\nR-1 R-2 R-L R-AVG\r\nBottom-Up Sum 41.22 18.68 38.34 32.75\r\nLede-3 40.38 17.66 36.62 31.55\r\nSeq2Seq + Attn 31.33 11.81 28.83 23.99\r\nGPT-2 TL;DR: 29.34 8.27 26.58 21.40\r\nRandom-3 28.78 8.63 25.52 20.98\r\nGPT-2 no hint 21.58 4.03 19.47 15.03\r\nTable 4.

Bottom-Up Sum is\r\nthe SOTA model from (Gehrmann et al., 2018)\r\n2018), is nearing the 89 F1 performance of humans. While\r\nGPT-2’s performance is exciting for a system without any su\u0002pervised training, some inspection of its answers and errors\r\nsuggests GPT-2 often uses simple retrieval based heuristics\r\nsuch as answer with a name from the document in response\r\nto a who question.\r\n3.6. Summarization\r\nWe test GPT-2’s ability to perform summarization on the\r\nCNN and Daily Mail dataset (Nallapati et al., 2016). To in\u0002duce summarization behavior we add the text TL;DR: after\r\nthe article and generate 100 tokens with Top-k random sam\u0002pling (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 2 which reduces repetition\r\nand encourages more abstractive summaries than greedy de\u0002coding. We use the first 3 generated sentences in these 100\r\ntokens as the summary. While qualitatively the generations\r\nresemble summaries, as shown in Table 14, they often focus\r\non recent content from the article or confuse specific details\r\nsuch as how many cars were involved in a crash or whether\r\na logo was on a hat or shirt. On the commonly reported\r\nROUGE 1,2,L metrics the generated summaries only begin\r\nto approach the performance of classic neural baselines and\r\njust barely outperforms selecting 3 random sentences from\r\nthe article. GPT-2’s performance drops by 6.4 points on\r\nthe aggregate metric when the task hint is removed which\r\ndemonstrates the ability to invoke task specific behavior in\r\na language model with natural language.\r\n3.7. Translation\r\nWe test whether GPT-2 has begun to learn how to translate\r\nfrom one language to another. In order to help it infer that\r\nthis is the desired task, we condition the language model\r\non a context of example pairs of the format english\r\nsentence = french sentence and then after a fi\u0002nal prompt of english sentence = we sample from\r\nthe model with greedy decoding and use the first generated\r\nsentence as the translation. On the WMT-14 English-French\r\ntest set, GPT-2 gets 5 BLEU, which is slightly worse than\r\na word-by-word substitution with a bilingual lexicon in\u0002ferred in previous work on unsupervised word translation",

Winograd Schema Challenge\r\nFigure 3. Performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge as a\r\nfunction of model capacity.\r\nThe Winograd Schema challenge (Levesque et al., 2012)\r\nwas constructed to measure the capability of a system to\r\nperform commonsense reasoning by measuring its ability\r\nto resolve ambiguities in text. Recently Trinh & Le (2018)\r\ndemonstrated significant progress on this challenge using\r\nLMs, by predicting the resolution of the ambiguity with\r\nhigher probability. We follow their problem formulation and\r\nvisualize the performance of our models with both full and\r\npartial scoring techniques in Figure 3. GPT-2 improves state\r\nof the art accuracy by 7%, achieving 70.70%. The dataset\r\nis quite small with only 273 examples so we recommend\r\nreading Trichelair et al. (2018) to help contextualize this\r\nresult.\r\n3.5. Reading Comprehension\r\nThe Conversation Question Answering dataset (CoQA)\r\nReddy et al. (2018) consists of documents from 7 different\r\ndomains paired with natural language dialogues between a\r\nquestion asker and a question answerer about the document.\r\nCoQA tests reading comprehension capabilities and also\r\nthe ability of models to answer questions that depend on\r\nconversation history (such as “Why?”).\r\nGreedy decoding from GPT-2 when conditioned on a doc\u0002ument, the history of the associated conversation, and a\r\nfinal token A: achieves 55 F1 on the development set. This\r\nmatches or exceeds the performance of 3 out of 4 base\u0002line systems without using the 127,000+ manually collected\r\nquestion answer pairs those baselines were trained on. The\r\nsupervised SOTA, a BERT based system (Devlin et al.,\r\nR-1 R-2 R-L R-AVG\r\nBottom-Up Sum 41.22 18.68 38.34 32.75\r\nLede-3 40.38 17.66 36.62 31.55\r\nSeq2Seq + Attn 31.33 11.81 28.83 23.99\r\nGPT-2 TL;DR: 29.34 8.27 26.58 21.40\r\nRandom-3 28.78 8.63 25.52 20.98\r\nGPT-2 no hint 21.58 4.03 19.47 15.03\r\nTable 4. Summarization performance as measured by ROUGE F1\r\nmetrics on the CNN and Daily Mail dataset. Bottom-Up Sum is\r\nthe SOTA model from (Gehrmann et al., 2018)\r\n2018), is nearing the 89 F1 performance of humans. While\r\nGPT-2’s performance is exciting for a system without any su\u0002pervised training, some inspection of its answers and errors\r\nsuggests GPT-2 often uses simple retrieval based heuristics\r\nsuch as answer with a name from the document in response\r\nto a who question.\r\n3.6. Summarization\r\nWe test GPT-2’s ability to perform summarization on the\r\nCNN and Daily Mail dataset (Nallapati et al., 2016). To in\u0002duce summarization behavior we add the text TL;DR: after\r\nthe article and generate 100 tokens with Top-k random sam\u0002pling (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 2 which reduces repetition\r\nand encourages more abstractive summaries than greedy de\u0002coding. We use the first 3 generated sentences in these 100\r\ntokens as the summary. While qualitatively the generations\r\nresemble summaries, as shown in Table 14, they often focus\r\non recent content from the article or confuse specific details\r\nsuch as how many cars were involved in a crash or whether\r\na logo was on a hat or shirt. On the commonly reported\r\nROUGE 1,2,L metrics the generated summaries only begin\r\nto approach the performance of classic neural baselines and\r\njust barely outperforms selecting 3 random sentences from\r\nthe article. GPT-2’s performance drops by 6.4 points on\r\nthe aggregate metric when the task hint is removed which\r\ndemonstrates the ability to invoke task specific behavior in\r\na language model with natural language.\r\n3.7. Translation\r\nWe test whether GPT-2 has begun to learn how to translate\r\nfrom one language to another. In order to help it infer that\r\nthis is the desired task, we condition the language model\r\non a context of example pairs of the format english\r\nsentence = french sentence and then after a fi\u0002nal prompt of english sentence = we sample from\r\nthe model with greedy decoding and use the first generated\r\nsentence as the translation. On the WMT-14 English-French\r\ntest set, GPT-2 gets 5 BLEU, which is slightly worse than\r\na word-by-word substitution with a bilingual lexicon in\u0002ferred in previous work on unsupervised word translation",

As the size of datasets increases this\r\nissue becomes increasingly likely which suggests a similar\r\nphenomena could be happening with WebText. Therefore it\r\nis important to analyze how much test data also shows up in\r\nthe training data.\r\nTo study this we created Bloom filters containing 8-grams\r\nof WebText training set tokens. To improve recall, strings\r\nwere normalized to contain only lower-cased alphanumeric\r\nwords with a single space as a delimiter. The Bloom filters\r\nwere constructed such that the false positive rate is upper\r\nbounded by 1\r\n108 . We further verified the low false positive\r\nrate by generating 1M strings, of which zero were found by\r\nthe filter.\r\nThese Bloom filters let us calculate, given a dataset, the\r\npercentage of 8-grams from that dataset that are also found\r\nin the WebText training set. Table 6 shows this overlap anal\u0002ysis for the test sets of common LM benchmarks. Common\r\nLM datasets’ test sets have between 1-6% overlap with Web\u0002Text train, with an average of overlap of 3.2%. Somewhat\r\nsurprisingly, many datasets have larger overlaps with their\r\nown training splits, with an average of 5.9% overlap.\r\nOur approach optimizes for recall, and while manual inspec\u0002tion of the overlaps shows many common phrases, there are\r\nmany longer matches that are due to duplicated data. This is\r\nnot unique to WebText. For instance, we discovered that the\r\ntest set of WikiText-103 has an article which is also in the\r\ntraining dataset. Since there are only 60 articles in the test\r\nset there is at least an overlap of 1.6%.4 Potentially more\r\nworryingly, 1BW has an overlap of nearly 13.2% with its\r\nown training set according to our procedure.\r\nFor the Winograd Schema Challenge, we found only 10\r\nschemata which had any 8-gram overlaps with the WebText\r\ntraining set. Of these, 2 were spurious matches. Of the\r\nremaining 8, only 1 schema appeared in any contexts that\r\n4A significant portion of additional overlap is due to editors\r\nreusing some paragraphs across multiple articles with a shared\r\ntheme such as various battles in the Korean War.\r\ngave away the answer.\r\nFor CoQA, about 15% of documents in the news domain\r\nare already in WebText and the model performs about 3\r\nF1 better on these. CoQA’s development set metric reports\r\nthe average performance over 5 different domains and we\r\nmeasure a gain of about 0.5-1.0 F1 due to overlap across the\r\nvarious domains. However, no actual training questions or\r\nanswers are in WebText since CoQA was released after the\r\ncutoff date for links in WebText.\r\nOn LAMBADA, the average overlap is 1.2%. GPT-2 per\u0002forms about 2 perplexity better on examples with greater\r\nthan 15% overlap. Recalculating metrics when excluding\r\nall examples with any overlap shifts results from 8.6 to 8.7\r\nperplexity and reduces accuracy from 63.2% to 62.9%. This\r\nvery small change in overall results is likely due to only 1\r\nin 200 examples having significant overlap.\r\nOverall, our analysis suggests that data overlap between\r\nWebText training data and specific evaluation datasets pro\u0002vides a small but consistent benefit to reported results. How\u0002ever, for most datasets we do not notice significantly larger\r\noverlaps than those already existing between standard train\u0002ing and test sets, as Table 6 highlights.\r\nUnderstanding and quantifying how highly similar text im\u0002pacts performance is an important research question. Better\r\nde-duplication techniques such as scalable fuzzy matching\r\ncould also help better answer these questions. For now, we\r\nrecommend the use of n-gram overlap based de-duplication\r\nas an important verification step and sanity check during the\r\ncreation of training and test splits for new NLP datasets.\r\nAnother potential way of determining whether the perfor\u0002mance of WebText LMs is attributable to memorization is\r\ninspecting their performance on their own held-out set. As\r\nshown in Figure 4, performance on both the training and\r\ntest sets of WebText are similar and improve together as\r\nmodel size is increased. This suggests even GPT-2 is still\r\nunderfitting on WebText in many ways.\r\nGPT-2 is also able to write news articles about the discovery\r\nof talking unicorns.

Text Memorization\r\nWe observe some memorizing behavior in GPT-2 on longer strings\r\nthat are repeated many times in the dataset such as famous quotes\r\nor speeches. For example, when conditioned on the first sentence\r\nand a half of the Gettysburg Address (which occurs approximately\r\n40 times throughout WebText), an argmax decode from GPT-2\r\nrecovers the speech. Even when sampling without truncation, we\r\nfind that the model copies the speech for awhile before drifting,\r\nalbeit in a similar style. It typically drifts within 100-200 tokens,\r\nand displays widening diversity once it drifts.\r\nTo quantify how often exact memorization shows up in samples,\r\nwe generated samples from GPT-2 conditioned on WebText test\r\nset articles and compared the overlap rates of GPT-2’s generations\r\nto the overlap rates of the ground-truth completions. The results of\r\nthis analysis are shown below and suggest that GPT-2 repeats text\r\nfrom the training set less often then the baseline rate of held-out\r\narticles.\r\nFigure 5. CDF of percentage 8-gram overlap with WebText train\u0002ing set, for both WebText test set and samples (conditioned on\r\nWebText test set, with top-k truncated random sampling with\r\nk = 40). Most samples have less than 1% overlap, including over\r\n30% of samples with no overlap, whereas the median for test set is\r\n2.6% overlap.\r\n8.3. Diversity\r\nTable 12 shows multiple completions of the same random WebText\r\ntest set context, showing the diversity of completions with standard\r\nsampling settings.\r\n8.4. Robustness\r\nTable 13 shows the previously mentioned talking unicorns news\r\narticle. We find the model to be capable of handling out of dis\u0002tribution contexts, but the quality of these samples is generally\r\nlower.",

I’m not about wearing a\r\nfull wool suit with sneakers (as GQ shows a lot) but I’m definitely open to keeping things casual, like this cotton\r\nDB. Casual fabrics are key to pulling off your sneakers in a dressed down menswear outfit. I’d even suggest to\r\nwear these sneakers with a khaki chino suit or a white linen suit.

These will\r\ndefinitely be an issue if you’re trying to work as a casual\r\nsneakermaker, and that’s OK but don’t hesitate if you\r\nwant to try the lower price versions of their outfits!\r\nThis version features a very low cut-cut neckline\r\n(which is not a bad thing), slightly longer legs, and a pair\r\nof long legs to keep things nice. My preferred color of\r\ncolor these items are blue-gray (which is my first colors,\r\nas they are a light white), or black (which is my favorite\r\nof my designs).

Even more surprising to the\r\nresearchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English.\r\nGPT-2: The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn. These\r\nfour-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.\r\nNow, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is fi\u0002nally solved.\r\nDr. Jorge Perez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several com- ´\r\npanions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals\r\nor humans. Perez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by ´\r\ntwo peaks of rock and silver snow.\r\nPerez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top ´\r\nof one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Perez. ´\r\nPerez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be ´\r\nseen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch\r\ntheir horns.\r\nWhile examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also\r\nspoke some fairly regular English. Perez stated, “We can see, for example, that they have a common ´\r\n‘language,’ something like a dialect or dialectic.”\r\nDr. Perez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals ´\r\nwere believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans\r\nin those parts of South America.\r\nWhile their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created\r\nwhen a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to Perez, ´\r\n“In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common.”\r\nHowever, Perez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if ´\r\nunicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. “But they seem to be able to\r\ncommunicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in\r\nsocial organization,” said the scientist.\r\nTable 13.

He moves around her office at work and goes\r\nshopping with her. ”Most people don’t seem to mind Tom,” says Catherine, who thinks he is wonderful. ”He’s my\r\nfourth child,” she says. She may think of him and treat him that way as her son. He moves around buying his food,\r\npaying his health bills and his taxes, but in fact Tom is a dog.\r\nCatherine and Tom live in Sweden, a country where everyone is expected to lead an orderly life accord\u0002ing to rules laid down by the government, which also provides a high level of care for its people. This level of care\r\ncosts money.\r\nPeople in Sweden pay taxes on everything, so aren’t surprised to find that owning a dog means more\r\ntaxes. Some people are paying as much as 500 Swedish kronor in taxes a year for the right to keep their dog, which\r\nis spent by the government on dog hospitals and sometimes medical treatment for a dog that falls ill. However, most\r\nsuch treatment is expensive, so owners often decide to offer health and even life for their dog.\r\nIn Sweden dog owners must pay for any damage their dog does. A Swedish Kennel Club official ex\u0002plains what this means: if your dog runs out on the road and gets hit by a passing car, you, as the owner, have to pay\r\nfor any damage done to the car, even if your dog has been killed in the accident.\r\nQ: How old is Catherine?\r\nA: 54\r\nQ: where does she live?\r\nA:\r\nModel answer: Stockholm\r\nTurker answers: Sweden, Sweden, in Sweden, Sweden\r\nTable 17.
