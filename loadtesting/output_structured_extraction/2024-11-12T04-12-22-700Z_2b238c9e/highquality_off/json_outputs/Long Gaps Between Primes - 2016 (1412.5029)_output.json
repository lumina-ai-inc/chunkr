INTRODUCTION\r\nLet pn denote the n\r\nth prime, and let\r\nG(X) := max\r\npn+16X\r\n(pn+1 − pn)\r\ndenote the the maximum gap between consecutive primes less than X. It is clear from the prime number\r\ntheorem that\r\nG(X) > (1 + o(1)) log X,\r\nas the average gap between the prime numbers which are 6 X is ∼ log X. In 1931, Westzynthius [43]\r\nproved that infinitely often, the gap between consecutive prime numbers can be an arbitrarily large multiple\r\nof the average gap, that is, G(X)/ log X → ∞ as X → ∞, improving upon prior results of Backlund [2]\r\n1",

If X takes at most countably many values, we define\r\nthe essential range of X to be the set of all X such that P(X = X) is non-zero, thus X almost surely takes\r\nvalues in its essential range. We also employ the following conditional expectation notation. If E is an event\r\nof non-zero probability, we write\r\nP(F|E) := P(F ∧ E)\r\nP(E)\r\nfor any event F, and\r\nE(X|E) := E(X1E)\r\nP(E)\r\nfor any (absolutely integrable) real-valued random variable X. If Y is another random variable taking at\r\nmost countably many values, we define the conditional probability P(F|Y) to be the random variable that\r\nequals P(F|Y = Y ) on the event Y = Y for each Y in the essential range of Y, and similarly define the\r\nconditional expectation E(X|Y) to be the random variable that equals E(X|Y = Y ) on the event Y = Y .\r\nWe observe the idempotency property\r\n(2.1) E(E(X|Y)) = EX\r\nwhenever X is absolutely integrable and Y takes at most countably many values.\r\nWe will rely frequently on the following simple concentration of measure result.\r\nLemma 2.1 (Chebyshev inequality). Let X, Y be independent random variables taking at most countably\r\nmany values. Let Y′ be a conditionally independent copy of Y over X; in other words, for every X in\r\nthe essential range of X, the random variables Y, Y′ are independent and identically distributed after\r\nconditioning to the event X = X. Let F(X, Y) be a (absolutely integrable) random variable depending on\r\nX and Y. Suppose that one has the bounds\r\n(2.2) EF(X, Y) = α + O(εα)\r\nand\r\n(2.3) EF(X, Y)F(X, Y′) = α\r\n2 + O(εα2\r\n)\r\nfor some α, ε > 0 with ε = O(1). Then for any θ > 0, one has\r\n(2.4) E(F(X, Y)|X) = α + O6(θ)\r\nwith probability 1 − O(\r\nεα2\r\nθ\r\n2 ).\r\nIn practice, we will often establish (2.2) and (2.3) by first computing the conditional expectations\r\nE(F(X, Y)|Y)\r\nand\r\nE(F(X, Y)F(X, Y′)|Y, Y′)\r\nand then using (2.1). Thus we see that we can control the X-conditional expectation of F(X, Y) via the\r\nY-conditional expectation, provided that we can similarly control the Y, Y′-conditional expectation of\r\nF(X, Y)F(X, Y′).",

Here, we show how this theorem implies (1.2), and hence\r\nTheorem 1.\r\nLet ~a and~b be as in Theorem 2. We extend the tuple ~a to a tuple (ap)p6x of congruence classes ap mod p\r\nfor all primes p 6 x by setting ap := bp for p ∈ P and ap := 0 for p 6∈ S ∪ P, and consider the sifted set\r\nT := {n ∈ [y]\\[x] : n 6≡ ap (mod p) for all p 6 x}.\r\nThe elements of T , by construction, are not divisible by any prime in (0, log20 x] or in (z, x/2]. Thus, each\r\nelement must either be a z-smooth number (i.e., a number with all prime factors at most z), or must consist\r\nof a prime greater than x/2, possibly multiplied by some additional primes that are all at least log20 x.\r\nHowever, from (3.1) we know that y = o(x log x). Thus, we see that an element of T is either a z-smooth\r\nnumber or a prime in Q. In the second case, the element lies in Q ∩S(~a)∩S(\r\n~b). Conversely, every element\r\nof Q ∩S(~a)∩ S(\r\n~b) lies in T . Thus, T only differs from Q ∩ S(~a) ∩ S(~b) by a set R consisting of z-smooth\r\nnumbers in [y].\r\nTo estimate #R, let\r\nu :=\r\nlog y\r\nlog z\r\n,\r\nso from (3.1), (3.2) one has u ∼ 4\r\nlog2 x\r\nlog3 x\r\n.

Here, we show how this theorem implies (1.2), and hence\r\nTheorem 1.\r\nLet ~a and~b be as in Theorem 2. We extend the tuple ~a to a tuple (ap)p6x of congruence classes ap mod p\r\nfor all primes p 6 x by setting ap := bp for p ∈ P and ap := 0 for p 6∈ S ∪ P, and consider the sifted set\r\nT := {n ∈ [y]\\[x] : n 6≡ ap (mod p) for all p 6 x}.\r\nThe elements of T , by construction, are not divisible by any prime in (0, log20 x] or in (z, x/2]. Thus, each\r\nelement must either be a z-smooth number (i.e., a number with all prime factors at most z), or must consist\r\nof a prime greater than x/2, possibly multiplied by some additional primes that are all at least log20 x.\r\nHowever, from (3.1) we know that y = o(x log x). Thus, we see that an element of T is either a z-smooth\r\nnumber or a prime in Q. In the second case, the element lies in Q ∩S(~a)∩S(\r\n~b). Conversely, every element\r\nof Q ∩S(~a)∩ S(\r\n~b) lies in T . Thus, T only differs from Q ∩ S(~a) ∩ S(~b) by a set R consisting of z-smooth\r\nnumbers in [y].\r\nTo estimate #R, let\r\nu :=\r\nlog y\r\nlog z\r\n,\r\nso from (3.1), (3.2) one has u ∼ 4\r\nlog2 x\r\nlog3 x\r\n.

            "content": "LONG GAPS BETWEEN PRIMES 11\r\nso in particular this set is roughly c log2 x times larger than P. In later sections, we will use the multidimen\u0002sional sieve from [32], [31] to locate for most primes p in P, a large number of residue classes bp mod p\r\nthat each intersect Q ∩ S(~a) in roughly ≍ log2 x elements on the average. If we let Ep be the set of all\r\nsuch intersections (bp mod p) ∩ V , then the task of making Q ∩ S(~a) ∩ S(\r\n~b) small is essentially the same\r\nas making the sifted set V \\\r\nS\r\np∈P ep small, for some suitable edges ep drawn from Ep. By double counting,\r\nthe expected density d here should be roughly\r\nd ≍\r\n#P × log2 x\r\n#V\r\n≍\r\n1\r\nc\r\n,\r\nand so one should be able to sieve out Q ∩ S(~a) more or less completely once c is small enough if one\r\nhad optimal sieving. In contrast, if one used independent sieving, one would expect the cardinality of\r\nQ ∩ S(~a) ∩ S(\r\n~b) to be something like exp(−1/c) × c\r\nx\r\nlog x\r\nlog2 x, which would only be acceptable if c was\r\nslightly smaller than 1\r\nlog3 x\r\n. This loss of log3 x ultimately leads to the loss of log4 X in (1.1) as compared\r\nagainst Theorem 1.\r\nIt is thus desirable to obtain a general combinatorial tool for achieving near-optimal sieve efficiency\r\nfor various collections (V, Ei)i∈I of hypergraphs. The result of Pippenger and Spencer [34] (extending\r\nprevious results of R¨odl [39] and Frankl and R¨odl [16], as well as unpublished work of Pippenger) asserts,\r\nvery roughly speaking, that one can almost attain this optimal efficiency under some further assumptions\r\nbeyond (i), which we state informally as follows:\r\n(ii) The hypergraphs (V, Ei) do not depend on i.\r\n(iii) The normalized codegrees P\r\ni∈I P(v, w ∈ ei) for v 6= w are small.\r\n(iv) The edges ei of Ei are of constant size, thus there is a k such that #ei = k for all i and all ei ∈ Ei.\r\nThe argument is based on the Rodl nibble ¨ from [39], which is a variant of the semi-random method from\r\n[1]. Roughly speaking, the idea is to break up the index set I into smaller pieces I1, . . . , Im. For the first\r\nI1, we perform a “nibble” by selecting the ei for i ∈ I1 uniformly and independently. For the next nibble at\r\nI2, we restrict (or condition) the ei for i ∈ I2 to avoid the edges arising in the first nibble, and then select ei\r\nfor i ∈ I2 independently at random using this conditioned distribution. We continue performing nibbles at\r\nI3, . . . , Im (restricting the edges at each nibble to be disjoint from the edges of previous nibbles) until the\r\nindex set I is exhausted. Intuitively, this procedure enjoys better disjointness properties than the completely\r\nindependent selection scheme, but it is harder to analyze the probability of success. To achieve the latter\r\ntask, Pippenger and Spencer rely heavily on the four hypotheses (i)-(iv).\r\nIn our context, hypothesis (iii) is easily satisfied, and (i) can also be established. Hypothesis (ii) is not\r\nsatisfied (the Ep vary in p), but it turns out that the argument of Pippenger and Spencer can easily be written\r\nin such a way that this hypothesis may be discarded. But it is the failure of hypothesis (iv) which is the\r\nmost severe difficulty: the size of the sets ep = (bp mod p) ∩ V can fluctuate quite widely for different\r\nchoices of p or bp. This creates an undesirable bias in the iterative nibbling process: with each nibble, larger\r\nedges ei have a reduced chance of survival compared with smaller edges, simply because they have more\r\nelements that could potentially intersect previous nibbles. Given that one expects the larger edges to be the\r\nmost useful for the purposes of efficient sieving, this bias is a significant problem. One could try to rectify\r\nthe issue by partitioning the edge sets Ei depending on the cardinality of the edges, and working on one\r\npartition at a time, but this seriously impacts hypothesis (i) in a manner that we were not able to handle.\r\nOur resolution to this problem is to modify the iterative step of the nibbling process by reweighting\r\nthe probability distribution of the ei at each step to cancel out the bias incurred by conditioning an edge\r\neito be disjoint from previous nibbles. It turns out that there is a natural choice of reweighting for this",

In later sections, we will use the multidimen\u0002sional sieve from [32], [31] to locate for most primes p in P, a large number of residue classes bp mod p\r\nthat each intersect Q ∩ S(~a) in roughly ≍ log2 x elements on the average. If we let Ep be the set of all\r\nsuch intersections (bp mod p) ∩ V , then the task of making Q ∩ S(~a) ∩ S(\r\n~b) small is essentially the same\r\nas making the sifted set V \\\r\nS\r\np∈P ep small, for some suitable edges ep drawn from Ep. By double counting,\r\nthe expected density d here should be roughly\r\nd ≍\r\n#P × log2 x\r\n#V\r\n≍\r\n1\r\nc\r\n,\r\nand so one should be able to sieve out Q ∩ S(~a) more or less completely once c is small enough if one\r\nhad optimal sieving. In contrast, if one used independent sieving, one would expect the cardinality of\r\nQ ∩ S(~a) ∩ S(\r\n~b) to be something like exp(−1/c) × c\r\nx\r\nlog x\r\nlog2 x, which would only be acceptable if c was\r\nslightly smaller than 1\r\nlog3 x\r\n. This loss of log3 x ultimately leads to the loss of log4 X in (1.1) as compared\r\nagainst Theorem 1.\r\nIt is thus desirable to obtain a general combinatorial tool for achieving near-optimal sieve efficiency\r\nfor various collections (V, Ei)i∈I of hypergraphs. The result of Pippenger and Spencer [34] (extending\r\nprevious results of R¨odl [39] and Frankl and R¨odl [16], as well as unpublished work of Pippenger) asserts,\r\nvery roughly speaking, that one can almost attain this optimal efficiency under some further assumptions\r\nbeyond (i), which we state informally as follows:\r\n(ii) The hypergraphs (V, Ei) do not depend on i.\r\n(iii) The normalized codegrees P\r\ni∈I P(v, w ∈ ei) for v 6= w are small.\r\n(iv) The edges ei of Ei are of constant size, thus there is a k such that #ei = k for all i and all ei ∈ Ei.\r\nThe argument is based on the Rodl nibble ¨ from [39], which is a variant of the semi-random method from\r\n[1]. Roughly speaking, the idea is to break up the index set I into smaller pieces I1, . . . , Im. For the first\r\nI1, we perform a “nibble” by selecting the ei for i ∈ I1 uniformly and independently. For the next nibble at\r\nI2, we restrict (or condition) the ei for i ∈ I2 to avoid the edges arising in the first nibble, and then select ei\r\nfor i ∈ I2 independently at random using this conditioned distribution. We continue performing nibbles at\r\nI3, . . . , Im (restricting the edges at each nibble to be disjoint from the edges of previous nibbles) until the\r\nindex set I is exhausted. Intuitively, this procedure enjoys better disjointness properties than the completely\r\nindependent selection scheme, but it is harder to analyze the probability of success. To achieve the latter\r\ntask, Pippenger and Spencer rely heavily on the four hypotheses (i)-(iv).\r\nIn our context, hypothesis (iii) is easily satisfied, and (i) can also be established. Hypothesis (ii) is not\r\nsatisfied (the Ep vary in p), but it turns out that the argument of Pippenger and Spencer can easily be written\r\nin such a way that this hypothesis may be discarded. But it is the failure of hypothesis (iv) which is the\r\nmost severe difficulty: the size of the sets ep = (bp mod p) ∩ V can fluctuate quite widely for different\r\nchoices of p or bp. This creates an undesirable bias in the iterative nibbling process: with each nibble, larger\r\nedges ei have a reduced chance of survival compared with smaller edges, simply because they have more\r\nelements that could potentially intersect previous nibbles. Given that one expects the larger edges to be the\r\nmost useful for the purposes of efficient sieving, this bias is a significant problem. One could try to rectify\r\nthe issue by partitioning the edge sets Ei depending on the cardinality of the edges, and working on one\r\npartition at a time, but this seriously impacts hypothesis (i) in a manner that we were not able to handle.\r\nOur resolution to this problem is to modify the iterative step of the nibbling process by reweighting\r\nthe probability distribution of the ei at each step to cancel out the bias incurred by conditioning an edge\r\neito be disjoint from previous nibbles. It turns out that there is a natural choice of reweighting for this",

Let (V, E) be a hypergraph, and let d > 1 be a quantity\r\nobeying the following:\r\n• One has d = o(#E).\r\n• All edges e in E have cardinality O(1).\r\n• For every v ∈ V , one has d 6 deg(v) ≪ d.\r\n• For every distinct v, w ∈ V , one has codeg(v, w) = o(d).\r\nThen we can find edges e1, . . . , el ∈ E with l .\r\n#E\r\nd\r\nsuch that\r\n(4.14) #(V \\(e1 ∪ · · · ∪ el)) = o(#V ).\r\nNote that for any given vertex v, the probability that a randomly selected edge e from E will cover v is\r\ndeg(v)\r\n#E\r\n, which is roughly d\r\nE\r\n. Thus the conclusion of the above corollary uses an essentially optimal number\r\nof edges.\r\nProof. By a diagonalization argument, it suffices for any fixed ε > 0 (independent of x) to show that one\r\ncan find edges e1, . . . , el ∈ E with l 6 (1 + ε)\r\n#E\r\nd\r\nsuch that\r\n#(V \\(e1 ∪ · · · ∪ el)) ≪ ε#V\r\nfor sufficiently large x.\r\nLet k > 1 be a fixed integer (depending on ε) to be chosen later, and let m = k\r\n2\r\n. For x large enough, we\r\ncan find a natural number n1 such that\r\n(4.15) #E\r\nd\r\n6 n1k 6\r\n\u0010\r\n1 +\r\nε\r\n2\r\n\u0011 #E\r\nd\r\n,\r\nand we define\r\nnj = ⌈n1e\r\n(1−j)/k⌉ (1 6 j 6 m).\r\nWe now verify the conditions of Corollary 2 with suitable choices of parameters D, r, κ, δ.

Let 0 < θ < 1 be a quantity\r\nindependent of x. Let L\r\n′ be a subset of L. We say that the tuple (A,L,P, B, x, θ) obeys Hypothesis 1 at\r\nL\r\n′\r\nif we have the following three estimates:\r\n(1) (A(x) is well-distributed in arithmetic progressions) We have\r\nX\r\nq6xθ\r\nmax\r\na\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n#A(x; q, a) −\r\n#A(x)\r\nq\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n≪\r\n#A(x)\r\nlog100k\r\n2\r\nx\r\n.\r\n(2) (PL,A(x) is well-distributed in arithmetic progressions) For any L ∈ L′, we have\r\nX\r\nq6xθ; (q,B)=1\r\nmax\r\na:(L(a),q)=1\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n#PL,A(x; q, a) −\r\n#PL,A(x)\r\nϕL(q)\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n\f\r\n≪\r\n#PL,A(x)\r\nlog100k\r\n2\r\nx\r\n.\r\n(3) (A(x) not too concentrated) For any q < xθ and a ∈ Z we have\r\n#A(x; q, a) ≪\r\n#A(x)\r\nq\r\n.\r\nIn [31] this definition was only given in the case L\r\n′ = L, but we will need the (mild) generalization to\r\nthe case in which L\r\n′\r\nis a (possibly empty) subset of L.\r\nAs is common in analytic number theory, we will have to address the possibility of an exceptional Siegel\r\nzero. As we want to keep all our estimates effective, we will not rely on Siegel’s theorem or its consequences\r\n(such as the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem). Instead, we will rely on the Landau-Page theorem, which we\r\nnow recall. Throughout, χ denotes a Dirichlet character.\r\nLemma 7.1 (Landau-Page theorem). Let Q > 100. Suppose that L(s, χ) = 0 for some primitive character\r\nχ of modulus at most Q, and some s = σ + it. Then either\r\n1 − σ ≫\r\n1\r\nlog(Q(1 + |t|)),\r\nor else t = 0 and χ is a quadratic character χQ, which is unique. Furthermore, if χQ exists, then its\r\nconductor qQ is square-free apart from a factor of at most 4, and obeys the lower bound\r\nqQ ≫\r\nlog2 Q\r\nlog2\r\n2 Q\r\n.\r\nProof. See e.g. [9, Chapter 14]. The final estimate follows from the bound 1− β ≫ q\r\n−1/2\r\nlog−2q for a real\r\nzero β of L(s, χ) with χ of modulus q, which can also be found in [9, Chapter 14]. \u0003\r\nWe can then eliminate the exceptional character by deleting at most one prime factor of qQ.\r\nCorollary 6. Let Q > 100. Then there exists a quantity BQ which is either equal to 1 or is a prime of size\r\nBQ ≫ log2 Q\r\nwith the property that\r\n1 − σ ≫\r\n1\r\nlog(Q(1 + |t|))",

Note that the admissibility of the r-tuple (h1, . . . , hr) implies the\r\nadmissibility of the linear forms n 7→ n + hip.\r\nA key point is that many of the key components of wk,Lp,B,R are essentially uniform in p. Indeed, for\r\nany prime s, the polynomial Qk\r\ni=1(n + hip) is divisible by s only at the residue classes −hip mod s. From\r\nthis we see that\r\nωLp(s) = #{hi (mod s)} whenever s 6= p.\r\nIn particular, ωLp\r\n(s) is independent of p as long as s is distinct from p, so\r\nS(Lp) = \u00121 + O\r\n\u0012\r\nk\r\nx\r\n\u0013\u0013 (8.1) S,\r\nSBW (Lp) = \u00121 + O\r\n\u0012\r\nk\r\nx\r\n\u0013\u0013 SBW ,\r\nfor some S, SBW independent of p, with the error terms uniform in p. Moreover, if s ∤ W B then s > 2k\r\n2\r\n,\r\nso all the hi are distinct mods (since the hi are less than 2k\r\n2\r\n). Therefore, if s ∤ pW B we have ωLp(s) = k\r\nand\r\n{js,1(Lp), . . . , js,ω(s)(Lp)} = {1, . . . , k}.\r\nSince all p ∈ P are at least x/2 > R, we have s 6= p whenever s 6 R. From this we see that Dk(Lp) ∩\r\n{(d1, . . . , dk) : Qk\r\ni=1 di 6 R} is independent of p, and so we have\r\nλ(d1,...,dk)(Lp) = S(Lp)\r\nS\r\nλ(d1,...,dk) =\r\n\u0012\r\n1 + O\r\n\u0012\r\nk\r\nx\r\n\u0013\u0013 λ(d1,...,dk)\r\n,\r\nfor some λ(d1,...,dk)independent of p, and where the error term is independent of d1, . . . , dk.\r\nIt is clear that w is non-negative and supported on P × [−y, y], and from (7.9) we have (6.7). We set\r\n(8.2) τ := 2\r\nBk\r\nϕ(B)\r\nk S(log R)\r\nk\r\n(log x)\r\nk\r\nIk\r\nand\r\n(8.3) u :=\r\nϕ(B)\r\nB\r\nlog R\r\nlog x\r\nkJk\r\n2Ik\r\n.\r\nSince B is either 1 or prime, we have\r\nϕ(B)\r\nB\r\n≍ 1,\r\nand from definition of R we also have\r\n(8.4)\r\nlog R\r\nlog x\r\n≍ 1.\r\nFrom (7.5) we thus obtain (6.3). From [31, Lemma 8.1(i)] we have\r\nS > x\r\n−o(1)\r\n,\r\nand from [31, Lemma 8.6] we have\r\nIk = x\r\no(1)\r\n,",

(In fact, we also have a matching upper bound τ 6 x\r\no(1), but we will\r\nnot need this.)\r\nIt remains to verify the estimates (6.4) and (6.5). We begin with (6.4). Let p be an element of P.

(The x\r\n1−c+o(1) error\r\narises from (6.7) and roundoff effects if y is not an integer.)

Fix q ∈ Q and i ∈ {1, . . . , k}. We introduce the set L˜\r\nq,i of linear forms\r\nL˜\r\nq,i,1, . . . ,L˜\r\nq,i,k, where\r\nL˜\r\nq,i,i(n) := n\r\nand\r\nL˜\r\nq,i,j(n) := q + (hj − hi)n (1 6 j 6 k, j 6= i)\r\nWe claim that this set of linear forms is admissible. Indeed, for any prime s 6= q, the solutions of\r\nn\r\nY\r\nj6=i\r\n(q + (hj − hi)n) ≡ 0 (mod s)\r\nare n ≡ 0 and n ≡ −q(hj − hi)\r\n−1\r\n(mod s) for hj 6≡ hi (mod s), the number of which is equal to #{hj\r\n(mod s)}. Thus,\r\nS(L˜\r\nq,i) = \u0012\r\n1 + O\r\n\u0012\r\nk\r\nx\r\n\u0013\u0013 S,\r\nSBW (L˜\r\nq,i) = \u0012\r\n1 + O\r\n\u0012\r\nk\r\nx\r\n\u0013\u0013 SBW ,\r\nas before. Again, for s ∤ W B we have that the hi are distinct (mod s), and so if s < R and s ∤ W B we\r\nhave ωL˜\r\nq,i\r\n(s) = k and\r\n{js,1(L˜\r\nq,i), . . . , js,ω(s)\r\n(L˜\r\nq,i)} = {1, . . . , k}.\r\nIn particular, Dk(L˜\r\nq,i) ∩ {(d1, . . . , dk) : Qk\r\ni=1 di 6 R} is independent of q, i and so\r\nλ(d1,...,dk)(L˜\r\nq,i) = \u0012\r\n1 + O\r\n\u0012\r\nk\r\nx\r\n\u0013\u0013 λ(d1,...,dk)\r\n,\r\nwhere again the O(\r\nk\r\nx\r\n) error is independent of d1, . . . , dk. From this, since q − hip takes values in [−y, y],\r\nwe have that\r\nwk,L˜\r\nq,i,B,R(p) = \u0012\r\n1 + O\r\n\u0012\r\nk\r\nx\r\n\u0013\u0013 wk,Lp,B,R(q − hip)",
