Due to a lot of games \r\nout there for every console, it is really hard to choose a game to cover. Jeanne D’ Arc for the \r\nPSP has kept me busy for more than 40 hours and it is one of the best games I’ve played for \r\nthe last year. \r\nTile-based strategy RPG is not a common genre nowadays and this game did just great to let \r\nplayers live the experience. Not to mention that the developer of this game is Level 5, the one \r\nresponsible for the PS2 hit (which I wrote a major guide as well) Rogue Galaxy. The anime \r\nstyle cinematics and greatly detailed cel-shaded environment is enough to stir my interest in \r\nthe game. \r\nAny feedback from you guys is very much appreciated. If you have corrections or suggestions \r\ntell me so; remember that I am doing this for FREE and I am investing my time and effort to \r\nmake this guide as helpful as possible. I will try to cover everything that needs to be covered \r\nbut I can’t guarantee you that this will be perfect. Since I love using screenshots to make the \r\nguide more effective, spoilers may also lie ahead so read with care. That’s all and I hope you \r\nwill find this guide useful. \r\n--Paul Vhayste ",

The game is \r\nnot that challenging and the learning curve to grasp the basics just takes less than an hour in \r\naverage. Seasoned strategy-RPG players may wish to read through some pointers to know \r\nwhat to expect from the game. \r\nGAME OVERVIEW \r\nJeanne D’ Arc is a tile-based, strategy-RPG game. What does that mean? Well, tile-based \r\nsince each stage is divided into squares or tiles, similar to a chessboard. Your characters can \r\nmove over the tiles, depending on their range, obstacles and ground elevation. \r\nIt is basically a strategy game with the essence of RPG. Common aspects of strategy-RPG \r\ngames include fixed locations that players can travel via the world map, intermission dialogs \r\nand cutscenes, plots are divided into chapters and there is no free navigation in towns or \r\nshops. In case you are not familiar with these, you will know more when you start to play the \r\ngame. ",

From time to time, FREE COMBAT stages will \r\nappear. These are free stages which rewards you with rare items upon clearing. Be warned \r\nthough, enemies here may be higher than your current level. \r\nAfter completing a stage, you can go back to some of the stages you cleared to train your \r\ncharacters and earn more items, skills stones and gold. \r\nIf you forgot what you’ll need to do in a mission, just press SQUARE to display your \r\nobjective. If the town has a shop, press TRIANGLE to enter the shop. If the stage has our \r\nobjective or free combat, press X. \r\nSHOPS \r\n \r\nShops are accessed directly accessed from the MAP. Most of their stocks are fixed and \r\noftentimes, newer shops have better items of course. You can use the gold you have acquired \r\nduring your battles to spend for your supplies and equipment. \r\nThe good thing about your shop menu is that you can scroll through your available characters \r\nand equipment, showing the stats bonuses available for them. Skills stones are also available \r\nfrom the shop, though they only sell common ones. ",

This can be accessed anywhere in the World Map or before \r\nyou enter the battlefield. \r\nDuring this screen, you can change weapons, armor and SKILL STONES. Each character has \r\ntheir own weapon specialization. This will be displayed under the character’s name. Hence, a \r\ncharacter specializing in using an Axe cannot wield a sword and so on. \r\nThis triangle indicates the elemental affiliation of the character. Basically, it \r\ntells which element a character or enemy strong and weak against. In this \r\nexample, the enemy doesn’t have any elemental affiliation. There are only three \r\nelements in the game. \r\nSOL (SUN) – Element of fire \r\nLUNA (MOON) – Element of Ice \r\nSTELLA (STAR) – Element of Wind \r\nAs you can see in the arrows, LUNA is strong against SOL, SOL is strong against STELLA and \r\nSTELLA is strong against LUNA. Understanding this concept is pretty simple. A SOL \r\ncharacter attacking a STELLA enemy can deal more damage than attacking a LUNA or \r\nanother SOL target. \r\nSTATUS \r\n \r\nBelow is the basic rundown and brief explanation of the character stats: \r\nLV Indicates the character’s level \r\nEXP Indicates how much EXP the character has acquired. Once it reaches 100, the \r\ncharacter gains a level. Any excess will be carried over. \r\nHP Health points; when characters level up, a fixed amount of HP is added to \r\ntheir max HP. Note that different characters gain different amount of HP \r\nwhen leveling up. Axe wielders gain the most HP during level up while the \r\nmagicians and archers gain the least. ",

Since MP is \r\nonly recovered this way and battles always start with characters on 0 MP, \r\ndon’t be surprised to find no MP during the status screen. \r\nATTACK This is also obvious. The higher score on this stat, the greater damage you can \r\ndeal. \r\nDEFENSE Determines your damage resistance rating \r\nACCURACY Increases the chance of hitting an enemy \r\nWALK MOV Determines how many tiles/squares you can move over during battles. \r\nMAGIC ATK Increases damage on magic-based attacks \r\nMAGIC DEF Determines your magic damage resistance \r\nEVADE Higher score means better chances of evading enemy attacks \r\nCRITICAL Increases the odds of dealing critical damage when attacking. \r\nSKILL STONES \r\nSkill stones play a great role in every battle, even turning the tide to your favor. Characters \r\ncan have a maximum of 6 skill slots. They are categorized to four types, each with its own \r\npower and effect. The RARITY (number of stars) of the skill determines how powerful and \r\nrare the skill is. Also, note that you can’t equip two of the same kind of skill stones. \r\nCOUP DE GRACE \r\nThese stones enable your character to use special attacks. Special attacks vary from weapon to \r\nweapon. I recommend having at least two special attacks with different attack ranges to suit \r\ndifferent battle conditions. Special attacks consume MP. Higher leveled Coup De Graces \r\nconsume a lot more MP, enabling you to activate them after several turns. \r\nINNATE ABILITIES \r\nThese are passive skills that are active for the whole duration of the battle. They don’t \r\nconsume MP and they have different benefits. Having at least one of these on your skill slot \r\nwill never hurt. \r\nMAGIC \r\n \r\nMagic stones allow your characters to cast offensive, support and healing spells. Anybody can \r\nequip and cast magic stones. Activating a magical stone skill consumes MP. ",

Similar to Innate stones, Support stones does \r\nnot consume MP. \r\nThe image above shows an example of a balanced skill set. Remember that different \r\ncharacters have their own strength, weaknesses and limitations so keep that in mind when \r\nequipping skill stones. With proper planning, you can patch off some of their weaknesses \r\nwithout affecting your chances of success. \r\nSKILL BINDING \r\nSkill binding is one of the very important features in the game. It allows you to forge skill \r\nstones and forge them into a much powerful version. Bonded skills are lost forever so save \r\noften before binding. \r\nOne good feature of the game is that it saves the formula you used to create the skills, so that \r\nyou can review the raw stones needed to create a stone you want. \r\nFor the complete formula of all skills, I recommend checking Sam Travis’ (TrueBlade85) Skill \r\nBinding faq1 \r\nRemember that NOT all skills can be acquired by skill binding. Some of the rare and hard to \r\nfind ones can only be stolen from enemies or if you’re lucky, get them as an item drop. \r\n \r\n1 (http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/psp/file/934454/50137)",

If you have \r\nplayed a strategy game before, you should be familiar with the mechanics already. If not, read \r\nthrough this section to learn more. \r\nPRE-BATTLE/ OUTFIT \r\nIt will be unwise to jump into battle without preparation. When entering a combat stage, you \r\nwill always have the chance to prepare your character’s equipment and skills before putting \r\nthem in the heat of the battle. If you plan to save, SAVE YOUR GAME ON A SEPARATE \r\nFILE. This is to prevent you from messing up your game because of an unwinable battle. \r\nDEPLOYMENT \r\nThis is the actual deployment of your characters on pre-selected starting points in the stage. \r\nThe maximum number of party members that can be deployed will be displayed on the upper \r\nright corner of your screen. In most of the battles, Jeanne will be one of the default \r\ncombatants. \r\nInitial deployment of your characters can be very important, especially in battles where the \r\nparty is surrounded, as shown in the image above. It is common knowledge already that \r\n“tanks” or characters with sturdy defense and high HP should always be in the frontlines. \r\nAxe-wielders and swordmen are the common choices in the frontlines. Thieves and spearmen \r\ncan stand as rear-guards or rear support. Spellcasters and archers should always be at the \r\nback. \r\nIn some cases that the starting points are pretty much spread out, consider the characters that \r\ncan take care of themselves and how soon can they get to each other’s support. You wouldn’t \r\nwant to put in your archer in the middle of enemies while your fighter is in the safety of an \r\nelevated ledge. ",

The completion of the player phase and enemy phase makes up a \r\nTURN. Each stage has individual required turns to finish. If you fail to clear the stage within \r\nthe required number of turns, it is game over. The number of turns available for the stage will \r\nbe displayed on the upper right corner of the screen. \r\nHIDDEN ITEMS \r\nIn every stage, there are hidden treasures. They can only be acquired when an ally is stepping \r\nover the very spot where the item is located. Fortunately, hidden items can be seen if any ally \r\nis just a tile beside it, in any direction. Just think of it as a 9-tile square where your character \r\nis in the center. \r\nIn the early part of the game, you’ll need to look for the hidden items manually. That means \r\nfinishing 99% of the enemies as fast as possible, letting one live for the few remaining turns \r\nand covering the whole area. Just remember the 9-tile square range of your characters to \r\ncover as much area as possible. \r\nWhen you obtain the skills Treasure Hunter (Collet) and Treasure Lover (Rose), equip them \r\nand you should see all the hidden treasures across the map, during the entire battle – as long \r\nas Collet or Rose remains alive during the whole ordeal. \r\nIt will be interesting to note that some rare, powerful weapons and GEMS are hidden on later \r\nstages this way.

The character’s range depends on his/her MOV stat. \r\nATTACK Order your character to attack enemies within his/her range (red tile). Attack \r\nrange depends on the weapon equipped. Swords, axes and staves have a one \r\ntile range. Spears have two tile range and archers have a long range, of \r\ncourse. Spellcaster’s magic attack range depends on the spell being cast. \r\nSKILLS Activate special or coup de grace attacks here. Requires a corresponding skill \r\nstone (red skillstone) \r\nITEMS Use an item from your stock. Range depends on the item being used. \r\nTRANSFORM Use the Gem on your armlet to transform into a magical warrior. (Menu \r\nappears only to the few selected armlet wielders) \r\nSTATUS Check your character’s equipment and stat. You can’t change equipment and \r\nskills on this menu \r\nWAIT End your character’s turn. \r\nTRANSFORMATION \r\nThere are select, main characters in the game that wield armlets. These give them the ability \r\nto transform into another powerful form. All stats increase and any damage dealt at the point \r\nof the transformation will be healed. They will have access to more powerful and unique \r\nspecial attacks. ",

You can collect more \r\ngems by completing free missions, finding hidden items and going through the story. \r\nArmlet wielders earn SP every turn (number of SP is shown under the character’s name). \r\nDifferent Gems require different amount of SP to be activated. A character can only stay on \r\nhis/her transformed form for two turns. A gem can only be activated once per battle so use it \r\nwisely. \r\nGODSPEED \r\n \r\nWhile on their transformed form, AWs can have an additional turn every time they defeat an \r\nenemy. It is not required that you consume your turn consecutively; upon activation of \r\nGodspeed, you can select another available character to act. When planned properly, you can \r\nchain several Godspeeds in case there are enemies that can’t be brought down with one \r\nattack. \r\nBASIC COMBAT\r\nWhen attacking, consider that attacking enemies from behind and from the sides increases \r\ndamage and hit rate. This can be applied to special attacks as well. \r\nAfter activating the WAIT command, four small arrows or pointers will appear over your \r\ncharacter. These arrows are actually the direction where your character will face while \r\nwaiting for his/her next turn. This is helpful when anticipating which direction the enemies \r\nwill likely approach, thus increases defense and evasion from attacks upfront. ",

Spellcasters counter by physical attacks. High \r\nevasion rating also increases counterattack chances. \r\nCOUP DE GRACE \r\nThese special attacks vary from the red skillstones equipped. Their range, damage area and \r\ndamage rating depends on the skillstone as well. To maximize efficiency, equip a special \r\nattack that damages one target (concentrated damage) and another one that affects an area \r\n(spread damage). After transformation, AWs have a unique special attack at their disposal, \r\naside from the normal red skill stones currently equipped. \r\nBURNING AURA \r\nAfter successfully damaging an enemy using a physical attack (bow damage not included), the \r\ntile on the other direction of your attack will have a Burning Aura. An ally directly stepping \r\non the tile has increased attack and critical hit rate. Effects of burning aura can be stacked on \r\nthe same character making it more effective. \r\nThe aura is active only during the whole turn (during player and enemy phases) and \r\ndisappears as soon as the next turn starts.

As usual, \r\nthe Gazelliaths love to use Mighty Roar when they have the chance so avoid placing your \r\ncharacters along a 3-tile straight line. The item locations are not hard to reach.

You can just let him \r\ndo the job of an infiltrator and take out nearby enemy units. \r\nFor the meantime, you should also have a main assault team that will break through the main \r\ngate and defenses. You can use Gilles’ Impale! skill if you have it equipped and take advantage \r\nof the defenders position in a straight line.

You should try and take time \r\nto experiment with all the available combinations you have in your current skillstone stock \r\nright now. Don’t worry, once bonded, the formula is saved so you can review them later. \r\nAlso, since you have Colet’s Skill Shakedown skill, try to steal good skillstones from certain \r\nenemies. And from now on, if you have Colet in your fighting team, make sure to check the \r\nindividual stats of enemies and review which one has the rare/uncommon skills you won’t \r\nnormally get on an enemy drop. A good example for this at this point of the game will be the \r\nMeteor Bolt skill from the dark elf in St. Loup, (red skillstone for your archers) and the \r\nCounter skill from the swordmaster at Orleans. \r\nOnce ready, go to the next stage. \r\nSTAGE 11: Breaching the Dark \r\nVICTORY: Defeat all enemies \r\nDEFEAT: A single ally falls in battle \r\nTURNS: 18 \r\nENEMIES: Glasdale, Knighted Lancer x5, Archer x1, Knighted Blade x7, Gargoyle x2 \r\nTIPS: Approach the first gate. Have someone with high mobility (such as Colet) to collect the \r\nfirst hidden item. (See below) As you defeat the initial enemies, reinforcements shall appear. \r\nDefeat them and breach the first gate. Additional reinforcements will appear on both sides; \r\nfrom the large rooms. Both rooms have items so send somebody to pick them up as well. \r\nContinue your push forward and make sure not to defeat Glasdale yet. Reach the last item \r\nnear the north eastern portion of the map, by the canal. Then, defeat Glasdale to complete the \r\nmission. Stage 12 will start immediate so save on a separate file, just to be safe. ",

I suggest entering this stage once your fighting team is at least LV30. This stage is worth \r\nclearing because it will reward you with a powerful spear and a great staff, which both are \r\nrare. \r\nThe Queen Rouge and the Qrow Leader have skillstones worth stealing so try to snatch them \r\nwhen you have the chance. The Qrows will be first ones to attack while the other enemies \r\nwon’t move unless you near their “territorial” range. So to start off, move your characters \r\nnorth (or left from your starting position) and engage the Qrows. They have really high \r\nevasion rates so you may want to hit them with offensive magics in case you can’t hit them \r\nphysically. Grab the item #1 also in the pond. \r\nOnce that is done, move a bit to the west to provoke the big enemies. Area damaging spells \r\nand skills help a lot here since larger targets such as dragons and golems occupy several tiles. \r\nHence, they receive damage for every tile affected by the attack. \r\nWhen facing dragons, avoid stacking your characters in a tight group. It is okay to spread \r\nthem out but not too wide or they won’t be coordinating attacks efficiently or worse, provoke \r\nthe other targets to move towards your position. You have better chance of winning when \r\nyou engage the enemies one by one. \r\nThe Queen Rouge has really high evasion rate and characters with higher accuracy ratings \r\ncan hit her. Fortunately, magic cannot be evaded so use your offensive spells to soften her. \r\nThe skillstones from the dragons and golems can’t be equipped to your characters but they \r\ncan be bonded to form new skills and fetch a higher price when sold to shops.

There \r\nare two exits. However, you can cross any of them to complete the mission. You must bring at \r\nleast two characters with healing ability. Bringing in a tank is okay but their limited \r\nmovement range will somehow require you to adjust your battle plan. Bringing in a magician \r\nor archer will be helpful but not necessary. \r\nFirst, check out the locations of the hidden items (see below) so that you can plan your escape \r\naccordingly. Make sure that nobody gets left behind. Once a character is near the escape \r\npoint, don’t have him go there yet. Wait for your other allies until all of them are near the \r\ngoal before escaping as a group. That way, in case an emergency happens, there is someone \r\nthat can provide support. \r\nFor Slinker, he is a bit of a nuisance so if ever you decide to take the southern wall, bring \r\nyour strongest characters and rush him. Heal often as needed. \r\nHidden Items: \r\n*starting point is from the north, facing south \r\n#1: [25, 22] The dead-end the northeastern part \r\nof the town, near the main gate \r\n#2: [4, 19] The dead-end in the northwestern \r\nportion of the town, behind the houses \r\n#3: [7, 11] Look for the small alley with two \r\nbarrels, just before the stairs leading to the west \r\nwall opening \r\n1 2\r\n3",

            "content": "44\r\nTips: Basically, this is an escort mission. And the bad part is that the queer-looking dauphin is \r\nuncontrollable so, he will take a stroll all by himself. But the worst part is that it takes only \r\none hit from ANY enemy attack to kill him. Yes, this is gonna be fun. \r\nOkay, to start off, there are three obvious routes to the chapel. The main path at the center is \r\nwhere the dauphin is taking so concentrate three of your characters there. Two should take a \r\nlead while another one guards the rear. I suggest leaving an archer to the rear so that he/she \r\ncan provide support from the main guards up front. \r\nFor your other three characters, you can have them take the other routes. Gilles equipped \r\nwith Demongriffe can take a route alone since his weapon can deal massive damage to \r\nenemies at this point. \r\nAfter killing the initial enemies, reinforcements will appear. The most dangerous probably is \r\nthe dark elf that will appear to the rear position, near your party’s starting point. Since you \r\nhave a guard there, eliminate the elf. After that, you’ll just need to worry about the enemies \r\nup front. \r\nOn the last approach before Mawra’s guards, I suggest positioning your front guards to block \r\nthe dauphin from advancing any further. Just hold the position and let your other allies to \r\npincer the enemy forces. \r\nHidden Items: \r\nThis item location will be available for this mission only. Free combat at Reims will be inside \r\nthe Cathedral. Also no screenshots were taken for the actual item locations. Please refer to \r\nthe coordinates below. ",

She uses a whip, charm enemies, steal gold and skillstones. With her on the team, you \r\ncan steal twice as many skillstones when paired with Colet. She can also setup ladders and \r\nbridges, like Colet. \r\nSellswords \r\nB: (19B) The Magician Girl – You will get Claire, another magician. She has really good stats \r\nto start with and it never hurts to have another staff user in the party. She can cast great \r\nmagics that can affect the whole battlefield. Now imagine having Richard and Claire to take \r\ncare of healing and offensive spells… \r\nWhatever path you choose, you will still follow the normal plot of the gameplay.

Remember that Lianne’s level will be Jeanne’s level at this \r\npoint. So during the outfit screen, equip the best equipment and skill you had with Lianne. If \r\npossible, try to bind an HP Recovery II from the HP Recovery skillstones you got from the \r\ntrolls from the last stage (if you bothered stealing them). Do the same for Gilles. \r\nLianne’s armlet however, won’t be equipped to Jeanne. She will have a new armlet instead; \r\nwith 5 gem slots in total. Transformation will be very helpful here. I suggest fighting \r\nnormally during the first turns. Once you damaged the lizards past half of their HP or if you \r\nneeded an HP boost, transform and Godspeed through them. I suggest waiting a few turns so \r\nthat you can store MP to use your special attack. Save it for the therions though. \r\nNow Slinker and Mawra are both easy kills. Expect Blaze to be as tough as La Hire, Rufus or \r\nBartolomeo. You can abuse Gilles’ two tile range to avoid getting countered himself and then \r\nfinish Blaze off with your Visiting Goddess attack. \r\nThere are two item points and try to get them if you only have one enemy on the field.

HP+150 and HP Recovery III are very essential on keeping \r\nJeanne alive during her struggle alone. Your team must reach her by opening rooms on both \r\nsides. To open a door, just have your character stack up by the door and end your turn. \r\nSuperbia has HP Recovery only but since his base HP is already high, he will recover 120HP \r\nper turn. It will be hard to damage him unless your attacks can deal 130+ damage per hit. \r\nAlso, he has EXP Bonus II that you can’t just get anywhere. Be sure to steal this later. \r\nIf you characters are really tough enough, you can divide your team into pairs and take both \r\npaths. There will be one item location on each path and one on the throne room. The western \r\nside of the chateau has a lot more enemies compared to the east side so bring your strongest \r\ncharacters there. The enemies aren’t that hard if your team is very well trained and equipped. \r\nThe ogres also provide the much needed HP Recovery skillstones. You can kill all other trolls \r\nand leave one for the stealing. \r\nHidden Items: \r\n#1: [13, 22] Throne room, west side \r\n#2: [28, 5] First room east, between the wall and the table \r\n#3: [3, 23] Third room northwest, beside bed \r\nREWARDS: \r\n738E \r\n2000G \r\nXheno Fruit (!!rare!!) \r\nMana Crystal \r\nUNLOCKED LOCATIONS: \r\nChateau Burgundy (Plot) \r\nGrandgris Pass (Free Combat) ",

The \r\nlarge crystals contain dragons while the smaller ones contain the normal fry. Since you can \r\ndeploy seven of your characters, I suggest bringing in your tanks since they will come in \r\nhandy. George will continue releasing enemies until the last batch in the centre of the field \r\nthat contains a powerful dragon called Tiamat, along with two demons. \r\nThe sooner you kill him the better. In his human form, George is just walking piece of lard. \r\nYour archers can take down this ba***rd with ease. After killing his human form, his reaper, \r\nnamed Aviritia will appear. Aviritia has really good rank 5 spells; these affect the whole field \r\nwhen cast, damaging every enemy. Good thing this reaper doesn’t have HP Recovery. \r\nAlso, Tiamat is a really tough dragon at this point. Unless your characters are power leveled \r\nto match Tiamat’s you won’t be able to defeat him in the limited turns you are given. You can \r\nprevent him from appearing by killing George as soon as possible. Also, you can battle tiamat \r\nalone when the free stage for Voldor Temple opens. Other than that, you shouldn’t have any \r\nproblems defeating this reaper and the enemies. \r\nHidden Items: \r\n1 2",

Magicians are helpful but not that necessary. \r\nJust like the last run-for-the-escape-route mission, I suggest moving as a group and wait for \r\nyour other members before boarding the boat. If you failed to escape using the first boat, you \r\nwill have difficulties on reaching the second boat for the next ten turns because of the \r\nreinforcements and waiting enemy units on the other side of the bridge. \r\nHidden Items: \r\n1 2",

They will only be available on your first \r\nvisit on the cemetery so make sure you nab them all. \r\nHidden Items: \r\nFree Stage: Colosseum (2nd Season) \r\nThe second “season” of the competition at the Colosseum will only be available after you \r\nfinish the game. The enemies have higher levels and the rewards are changed, of course. The \r\nsame rule applies; fight through 10 battles. You will be asked after every round to continue \r\nthe fight (No Yield) or leave (Yield), with all your accrued exp, items and gold. When you \r\nvisit the Colosseum again, you will start from the 1st round. This time, you can fight with a \r\nparty of 5 members and all rounds are comprised of 20 turns. \r\nEnemy levels range from 51-70. So make sure your characters are at least level 60 above. \r\nYou’ll need to consider some of the following as well: \r\n• Choose your main party members and train them before entering the Colosseum \r\n• Assign your “power five” to specific roles. Assign who will serve as the main \r\nattackers, support units and artillery. Normally, a spearman, an axe-wielder, a \r\nswordsman, mage and archer will make an excellent all-around battle party.

Equip him with a \r\nLucifer Axe and the best armor you can get at the moment – maybe the Firedrake \r\nArmor from Tiamat on the Free Stage of Voldor Temple. For skills, Helm Splitter, \r\nDesperation III, Mobility +2, Three Rounds, HP Recovery III and HP +150 will be the \r\nbest choices. \r\n• Spearman – Gilles of course. Gae Bulg is the ultimate spear so equip it to him. For \r\nskills, you can choose any red skillstone as his special attack, Piercing Power III to \r\ndeliver heavy damage to distant targets and the basic skills listed above. \r\n• Healer – Richard or Claire; for a healer, the most important spell is Revivify. This \r\nspell will allow you resurrect fallen members. You can equip him with HP+150, HP \r\nRecovery III, Mobility +2, Revivify and you can choose two more skills. I’d prefer an \r\nattack spell (avoid using the ultimate spells since they take too much time to cast) and \r\na healing spell (Healing Wind II is good but if you really need to heal often, just \r\nbringing in Heal II is fine) Mobility +2 will allow your healer to run into a safe \r\nlocation if cornered. \r\n• Rogue or Thief – A high level Rogue (Colet) or Thief (Rose) can evade almost all \r\nattacks, except magical and special attacks. Not to mention that though they don’t \r\nhave that high attack ratings, HP and defense, their critical hit, accuracy and evasion \r\nare so pumped up that they can be good choices of producing Burning Auras without \r\ngetting damaged by enemy counter attacks. They can provide much needed \r\ndistraction especially when a vital character (such as the healer) is in risk of getting \r\ncornered. ",

            "content": "88\r\nFor the last member, you can put in another tank or spearman. I just didn’t include archers \r\nbecause even with the Bow of Artemis and Attack +30 equipped, they will just deal very little \r\nto no damage at all against bosses. You chances of defeating enemies quickly is by generating \r\nstrategically positioned Burning Auras then attack them. Having the Godspeed skill equipped \r\nto your main attacker can also make quick work on enemies. \r\nHow to train your characters: \r\nThe best way to train your characters is equipping them with Exp Bonus IV (Exp Bonus III+ \r\nExp Bonus III). This skillstone will allow characters to get 300% experience! Exp points are \r\nrelative to the level of the target and the character. When lower level characters deal damage \r\nto higher level enemies, they gain more exp. But if your character is higher than the target, \r\nthe minimum exp pts that they can get per attack is 5. So with the Exp Bonus IV equipped, \r\ncharacters can gain 15 pts per hit on normal attacks – even on weaker enemies. \r\nNext, equip them with Three Rounds. Normally, after three successful hits, characters can \r\nonly get 15 pts. Now with Exp Bonus IV, players can get a minimum of 45 pts if all three \r\nattacks connect. \r\nSince exp is based on every successful hit (even if the defending enemy has blocked it), area\u0002damaging skills like Sweep, Compass, Salvo, etc has the possibility to yield over 100 pts per \r\nattack. \r\nWhere to train your characters: \r\nSome of my suggestions where you can train while reaping rewards are the following. \r\nChalons, Grandgris Pass and Voldor Temple. Chalons has weak enemies, but will reward you \r\nwith ExpBonus II upon completion, along with other good rewards. Four Exp Bonus II \r\nskillstones = Exp Bonus IV. After collecting at least 5 (your choice) then you can train next at \r\nGrandgris Pass. \r\nGrandgris Pass is a good place to train because of several reasons. First is that enemies here \r\nhave higher levels here compared to the other free stages. The Shadow Knights have really \r\nhigh HPs and fairly weak attacks so they make good targets for multiple attacks. Second, the \r\ndragon on the starting point is a great target for area–of-effect attacks and spells; thus chances \r\nof earning higher exp pts. Third, the bridge makes a good bottleneck position, thus piling up \r\nenemies and hitting them with attacks. ",

            "content": "90\r\nWith that said, I will just discuss the final two rounds of the Colosseum since those are the \r\nrounds that could give you problems, even with really trained characters. \r\nRound 9 \r\nTurns: 20 \r\nParty: 5/5 \r\nEnemies: Avaritia (reaper) LV86, Luxuria (reaper) LV86 , \r\n Superbia (reaper) LV86, Frost Demon LV86 (x4) \r\nRewards: 5000G, Healing Extract \r\nNotes: Have your tank equipped with Mobility +2 or +3 and Godspeed to eliminate \r\nthe demons first. Once that is done, take down Aviritia first since he doesn’t \r\nhave HP Recovery and his attacks are not that powerful compared to the \r\nother two. If your tank still has one available move because of Godspeed, \r\nmake sure that you create Burning Auras in the same spot, as much as \r\npossible. To do this, attack with your spearman first. Then, position your \r\nshort range attacker and attack again on the same direction. If both characters \r\nexecuted Three Rounds successfully, a very saturated aura will be produced. \r\nMove your tank to the aura and strike a heavy blow. \r\n Superbia has the highest attack of all the three and it can really cause \r\nproblems. With that in mind, avoid attacking him with ordinary attacks, \r\nespecially if his counterattack damage is greater than yours. Activating a three \r\nround attack can be fatal to your character in that scenario. \r\n Protect your healer at all costs! If possible, keep them out of reach from the \r\nreapers, but not too far away to provide support when needed. The best way \r\nto defeat them is by lowering their defense (Helm Splitter) and effective use \r\nof Burning Auras. Heal often as well. Don’t rely on HP Recovery too much. \r\nAs much as possible, always keep your character’s HP 70-100% full. \r\n \r\n ",

One dragon is replaced by Tiamat with a \r\n whooping 3000+ HP. Next is a kick-ass Luther with all his previous skills but \r\n with increased stats and HP Recovery (500+ recovery) Bedford is still a \r\n pushover and the other dragon is much more of a nuisance than a threat. \r\n Okay, same tactics apply; get rid of Bedford as early as possible. Then, move \r\n your characters on the far end of the map, away from Tiamat. Its Poison \r\n Breath attack can really annoy you; not to mention it will reduce the \r\n efficiency of your HP recovery. Don’t worry, Luther will chase after you and \r\n since dragons have really low movement range, it will take another 3-4 turns \r\n before Tiamat gets into attack range. \r\n During that time, make sure your characters have already setup their \r\n formations. Again, avoid using ordinary attacks against Luther, unless your \r\n character has full HP and a healer is on standby behind him/her. Helm \r\n Splitter will prove to be very useful here, aside from abusing the use of \r\n Burning Auras. Luther’s HP Recovery III can quickly get him back to his toes \r\n so make sure your guys can deal enormous damage to him when you have the \r\n chance. \r\n \r\n After defeating Luther, concentrate on the ordinary dragon then lastly, \r\n Tiamat. Tiamat is not that hard, compared to the old geezer. Just heal and use \r\n area damaging skills often. \r\nFree Stages (Post game)\r\nPost game free stages have “upgraded” rewards and enemies. Below is the list of the rewards \r\nyou can obtain from them. Note that you can clear the stage again and still get the same items \r\n– great for having multiple copies of the skillstones you might need for binding. ",

Some of the \r\nbasic and unique skills can’t be bonded and can only be acquired. \r\nSkill Name Equip at LV MP Cost Effect Rarity \r\nFollow Me! \r\nMighty Roar + Raise Force \r\nMighty Roar + Attack + 3 \r\n5 20 + Attack, four panel \r\ncross \r\nFollow Me! 2 \r\nFollow Me + Mighty Roar \r\nFollow Me + Attack + 10 \r\n25 30 + Attack, one panel each \r\nsurrounding the user \r\nJugulaire \r\nWood Chop + Sniper 2 \r\nCritical Edger + Triple Slash \r\n55 28 Critical up \r\nBlood Sword \r\nHP 50 + Spirit Sword \r\nHP Recovery + Spirit Sword \r\n25 30 Damage, absorb ½ HP \r\nfrom damage \r\nBlood Sword II \r\nMagic Attack +10 + Blood Sword \r\nHP Recovery 2 + Blood Sword \r\n42 82 Damage, absorb same \r\namount of HP from \r\ndamage \r\nTriple Slash \r\nFlash Strike + Crescent Arc \r\nFlash Strike + Cyclone \r\n18 51 Damage to one enemy \r\nHeaven's Gate \r\nHeal 2 + Triple Slash \r\nTempest Sword + Undead Slayer \r\n37 100 Heavy damage to one \r\nenemy \r\nCrescent Arc \r\nFlash Strike + Luna Spirit 1 \r\nAttack + 3 + Luna Spirit 1 \r\n10 34 Damage 3 horizontal \r\npanels in front \r\nSpirit Sword \r\nIce Bullet 2 + Attack + 5 \r\nSkewer Shot + Crescent Arc \r\n19 52 Damage, four panel cross \r\nTempest Sword \r\nSpirit Sword + Cyclone 2 \r\nCyclone 2 + Sweep \r\n26 75 Damage four panel front \r\n \r\n3 Thanks to Sam Travis (TrueBlade85) for letting me borrow the missing formulae from his guide in Gamefaqs \r\n(http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/psp/file/934454/50137)",
