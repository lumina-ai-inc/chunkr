These few-shot\r\nproperties first appeared when scaling models to a\r\nsufficient size (Kaplan et al., 2020), resulting in a\r\nline of work that focuses on further scaling these\r\nmodels (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Rae et al., 2021).\r\nThese efforts are based on the assumption that\r\nmore parameters will lead to better performance.\r\nHowever, recent work from Hoffmann et al. (2022)\r\nshows that, for a given compute budget, the best\r\nperformances are not achieved by the largest mod\u0002els, but by smaller models trained on more data.\r\nThe objective of the scaling laws from Hoff\u0002mann et al. (2022) is to determine how to best\r\nscale the dataset and model sizes for a particular\r\ntraining compute budget. However, this objective\r\ndisregards the inference budget, which becomes\r\ncritical when serving a language model at scale.\r\nIn this context, given a target level of performance,\r\nthe preferred model is not the fastest to train but the\r\nfastest at inference, and although it may be cheaper\r\nto train a large model to reach a certain level of\r\n∗ Equal contribution.

For instance,\r\nalthough Hoffmann et al.

The\r\nresulting models, called LLaMA, ranges from 7B\r\nto 65B parameters with competitive performance\r\ncompared to the best existing LLMs. For instance,\r\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench\u0002marks, despite being 10× smaller.

For the most part, we reuse data sources\r\nthat have been leveraged to train other LLMs, with\r\nthe restriction of only using data that is publicly\r\navailable, and compatible with open sourcing. This\r\nleads to the following mixture of data and the per\u0002centage they represent in the training set:\r\nEnglish CommonCrawl [67%]. We preprocess\r\nfive CommonCrawl dumps, ranging from 2017\r\nto 2020, with the CCNet pipeline (Wenzek et al.,\r\n2020). This process deduplicates the data at the\r\nline level, performs language identification with\r\na fastText linear classifier to remove non-English\r\npages and filters low quality content with an n\u0002gram language model. In addition, we trained a\r\nlinear model to classify pages used as references\r\nin Wikipedia v.s. randomly sampled pages, and\r\ndiscarded pages not classified as references.\r\nC4 [15%]. During exploratory experiments, we\r\nobserved that using diverse pre-processed Com\u0002monCrawl datasets improves performance. We thus\r\nincluded the publicly available C4 dataset (Raffel\r\net al., 2020) in our data. The preprocessing of C4\r\nalso contains deduplication and language identifi\u0002cation steps: the main difference with CCNet is\r\nthe quality filtering, which mostly relies on heuris\u0002tics such as presence of punctuation marks or the\r\nnumber of words and sentences in a webpage.\r\nGithub [4.5%]. We use the public GitHub\r\ndataset available on Google BigQuery. We only\r\nkept projects that are distributed under the Apache,\r\nBSD and MIT licenses. Additionally, we filtered\r\nlow quality files with heuristics based on the line\r\nlength or proportion of alphanumeric characters,\r\nand removed boilerplate, such as headers, with reg\u0002ular expressions. Finally, we deduplicate the result\u0002ing dataset at the file level, with exact matches.\r\nWikipedia [4.5%].

We perform\r\ndeduplication at the book level, removing books\r\nwith more than 90% content overlap.\r\nArXiv [2.5%]. We process arXiv Latex files\r\nto add scientific data to our dataset. Following\r\nLewkowycz et al. (2022), we removed everything\r\nbefore the first section, as well as the bibliography.\r\nWe also removed the comments from the .tex files,\r\nand inline-expanded definitions and macros written\r\nby users to increase consistency across papers.\r\nStack Exchange [2%]. We include a dump of\r\nStack Exchange, a website of high quality ques\u0002tions and answers that covers a diverse set of do\u0002mains, ranging from computer science to chemistry.\r\nWe kept the data from the 28 largest websites, re\u0002moved the HTML tags from text and sorted the\r\nanswers by score (from highest to lowest).\r\nTokenizer. We tokenize the data with the byte\u0002pair encoding (BPE) algorithm (Sennrich et al.,\r\n2015), using the implementation from Sentence\u0002Piece (Kudo and Richardson, 2018).

We provide a textual description\r\nof the task and a test example. The model\r\neither provides an answer using open-ended\r\ngeneration, or ranks the proposed answers.\r\n• Few-shot. We provide a few examples of the\r\ntask (between 1 and 64) and a test example.\r\nThe model takes this text as input and gener\u0002ates the answer or ranks different options.\r\nWe compare LLaMA with other foundation mod\u0002els, namely the non-publicly available language\r\nmodels GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), Gopher (Rae\r\net al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022)\r\nand PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), as well as\r\nthe open-sourced OPT models (Zhang et al., 2022),\r\nGPT-J (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), and GPT\u0002Neo (Black et al., 2022). In Section 4, we also\r\nbriefly compare LLaMA with instruction-tuned\r\nmodels such as OPT-IML (Iyer et al., 2022) and\r\nFlan-PaLM (Chung et al., 2022).\r\nWe evaluate LLaMA on free-form generation\r\ntasks and multiple choice tasks. In the multiple\r\nchoice tasks, the objective is to select the most\r\nappropriate completion among a set of given op\u0002tions, based on a provided context. We select the\r\ncompletion with the highest likelihood given the\r\nprovided context. We follow Gao et al. (2021)\r\nand use the likelihood normalized by the number\r\nof characters in the completion, except for certain\r\ndatasets (OpenBookQA, BoolQ), for which we fol\u0002low Brown et al.

All the re\u0002ported numbers are from the corresponding papers.\r\nDespite the simplicity of the instruction finetuning\r\napproach used here, we reach 68.9% on MMLU.\r\nLLaMA-I (65B) outperforms on MMLU existing\r\ninstruction finetuned models of moderate sizes, but\r\nare still far from the state-of-the-art, that is 77.4\r\nfor GPT code-davinci-002 on MMLU (numbers\r\ntaken from Iyer et al.

The details of the\r\nperformance on MMLU on the 57 tasks can be\r\nfound in Table 16 of the appendix.\r\n5 Bias, Toxicity and Misinformation\r\nLarge language models have been showed to re\u0002produce and amplify biases that are existing in\r\nthe training data (Sheng et al., 2019; Kurita et al.,\r\n2019), and to generate toxic or offensive con\u0002tent (Gehman et al., 2020). As our training dataset\r\ncontains a large proportion of data from the Web,\r\nwe believe that it is crucial to determine the po\u0002tential for our models to generate such content.\r\nTo understand the potential harm of LLaMA-65B,\r\nwe evaluate on different benchmarks that measure\r\ntoxic content production and stereotypes detection.\r\nWhile we have selected some of the standard bench\u0002marks that are used by the language model com\u0002munity to indicate some of the issues with these\r\nmodels, these evaluations are not sufficient to fully\r\nunderstand the risks associated with these models.",

There is a very large\r\nrange of toxic content that a model can generate,\r\nmaking a thorough evaluation challenging. Several\r\nrecent work (Zhang et al., 2022; Hoffmann et al.,\r\n2022) have considered the RealToxicityPrompts\r\nbenchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) as an indicator\r\nof how toxic is their model. RealToxicityPrompts\r\nconsists of about 100k prompts that the model must\r\ncomplete; then a toxicity score is automatically\r\nevaluated by making a request to PerspectiveAPI 3.\r\nWe do not have control over the pipeline used by\r\nthe third-party PerspectiveAPI, making comparison\r\nwith previous models difficult.\r\nFor each of the 100k prompts, we greedily gen\u0002erate with our models, and measure their toxic\u0002ity score. The score per prompt ranges from 0\r\n(non-toxic) to 1 (toxic). In Table 11, we report our\r\naveraged score on basic and respectful prompt cat\u0002egories of RealToxicityPrompts. These scores are\r\n“comparable” with what we observe in the litera\u0002ture (e.g., 0.087 for Chinchilla) but the method\u0002ologies differ between these work and ours (in\r\nterms of sampling strategy, number of prompts and\r\ntime of API). We observe that toxicity increases\r\n3\r\nhttps://perspectiveapi.com/\r\nBasic Respectful\r\nLLaMA\r\n7B 0.106 0.081\r\n13B 0.104 0.095\r\n33B 0.107 0.087\r\n65B 0.128 0.141\r\nTable 11: RealToxicityPrompts. We run a greedy de\u0002coder on the 100k prompts from this benchmark. The\r\n“respectful” versions are prompts starting with “Com\u0002plete the following sentence in a polite, respectful, and\r\nunbiased manner:”, and “Basic” is without it. Scores\r\nwere obtained using the PerplexityAPI, with higher\r\nscore indicating more toxic generations.\r\nwith the size of the model, especially for Respect\u0002ful prompts. This was also observed in previous\r\nwork (Zhang et al., 2022), with the notable excep\u0002tion of Hoffmann et al. (2022) where they do not\r\nsee a difference between Chinchilla and Gopher,\r\ndespite different sizes. This could be explained by\r\nthe fact that the larger model, Gopher, has worse\r\nperformance than Chinchilla, suggesting that the\r\nrelation between toxicity and model size may only\r\napply within a model family.",

WinoGender is made of Wino\u0002grad schema, and biases are evaluated by determin\u0002ing if a model co-reference resolution performance\r\nis impacted by the gender of the pronoun.\r\nMore precisely, each sentence has three men\u0002tions: an “occupation”, a “participant”, and a\r\n“pronoun” where the pronoun is co-referencing\r\neither the occupation or participant. We prompt\r\nthe model to determine the co-reference relation\r\nand measure if it does so correctly according to\r\nthe context of the sentence. The goal is to reveal\r\nif societal biases associated with occupations\r\nhave been captured by the model. For example,\r\na sentence in the WinoGender dataset is “The\r\nnurse notified the patient that his shift would be\r\nending in an hour.”, which is followed by ‘His’\r\nrefers to. We then compare the perplexity of the\r\ncontinuations the nurse and the patient to per\u0002form co-reference resolution with the model. We\r\nevaluate the performance when using 3 pronouns:\r\n“her/her/she”, “his/him/he” and “their/them/some\u0002one” (the different choices corresponding to the\r\ngrammatical function of the pronoun.\r\nIn Table 13, we report the co-reference scores\r\nfor the three different pronouns contained in the\r\ndataset. We observe that our model is significantly\r\nbetter at performing co-reference resolution for\r\nthe “their/them/someone” pronouns than for the\r\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns. A simi\u0002lar observation was made in previous work (Rae\r\net al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022), and is likely\r\nindicative of gender bias. Indeed, in the case of the\r\n“her/her/she” and “his/him/he” pronouns, the model\r\nis probably using the majority gender of the occu\u0002pation to perform co-reference resolution, instead\r\nof using the evidence of the sentence.\r\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, we look\r\nat the set of “gotcha” cases for the “her/her/she”\r\nand “his/him/he” pronouns in the WinoGender\r\ndataset. Theses cases correspond to sentences in\r\nwhich the pronoun does not match the majority\r\ngender of the occupation, and the occupation is\r\nthe correct answer. In Table 13, we observe that\r\nour model, LLaMA-65B, makes more errors on the\r\ngotcha examples, clearly showing that it capture\r\nsocietal biases related to gender and occupation.\r\nThe drop of performance exists for “her/her/she”\r\nand “his/him/he” pronouns, which is indicative of\r\nbiases regardless of gender.\r\n5.4 TruthfulQA\r\nTruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021) aims to measure the\r\ntruthfulness of a model, i.e., its ability to identify\r\nwhen a claim is true. Lin et al. (2021) consider\r\nthe definition of “true” in the sense of “literal truth\r\nabout the real world”, and not claims that are only\r\ntrue in the context of a belief system or tradition.\r\nThis benchmark can evaluate the risks of a model\r\nto generate misinformation or false claims.

We report the fraction of truth\u0002ful and truthful*informative answers, as scored by spe\u0002cially trained models via the OpenAI API. We follow\r\nthe QA prompt style used in Ouyang et al. (2022), and\r\nreport the performance of GPT-3 from the same paper.\r\nIn Table 14, we report the performance of our\r\nmodels on both questions to measure truthful mod\u0002els and the intersection of truthful and informative.\r\nCompared to GPT-3, our model scores higher in\r\nboth categories, but the rate of correct answers is\r\nstill low, showing that our model is likely to hallu\u0002cinate incorrect answers.\r\n6 Carbon footprint\r\nThe training of our models have consumed a mas\u0002sive quantity of energy, responsible for the emis\u0002sion of carbon dioxide. We follow the recent liter\u0002ature on the subject and breakdown both the total\r\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot\u0002print in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\r\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\r\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis\u0002sions, tCO2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\r\nWh = GPU-h×(GPU power consumption)×PUE,\r\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\r\nat 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\r\nthe location of the data center used to train the net\u0002work. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\r\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\r\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead\u0002ing to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in\r\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\r\nof these models if they were trained in the same\r\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\r\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\r\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\r\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\r\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\r\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\r\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\r\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\r\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\r\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\r\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\r\nour models. This means that developing these mod\u0002els would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\r\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\r\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\r\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\r\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\r\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\r\n7 Related work\r\nLanguage models are probability distributions\r\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac\u0002ters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\r\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\r\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\r\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\r\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\r\nby using language through the “imitation game”,\r\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench\u0002mark to measure progress toward artificial intelli\u0002gence (Mahoney, 1999).\r\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models\r\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\r\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\r\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\r\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In the\r\npast two decades, neural networks have been suc\u0002cessfully applied to the language modelling task,\r\n4\r\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/\r\ntree/main/projects/OPT/chronicles",

We report the fraction of truth\u0002ful and truthful*informative answers, as scored by spe\u0002cially trained models via the OpenAI API. We follow\r\nthe QA prompt style used in Ouyang et al. (2022), and\r\nreport the performance of GPT-3 from the same paper.\r\nIn Table 14, we report the performance of our\r\nmodels on both questions to measure truthful mod\u0002els and the intersection of truthful and informative.\r\nCompared to GPT-3, our model scores higher in\r\nboth categories, but the rate of correct answers is\r\nstill low, showing that our model is likely to hallu\u0002cinate incorrect answers.\r\n6 Carbon footprint\r\nThe training of our models have consumed a mas\u0002sive quantity of energy, responsible for the emis\u0002sion of carbon dioxide. We follow the recent liter\u0002ature on the subject and breakdown both the total\r\nenergy consumption and the resulting carbon foot\u0002print in Table 15. We follow a formula for Wu et al.\r\n(2022) to estimate the Watt-hour, Wh, needed to\r\ntrain a model, as well as the tons of carbon emis\u0002sions, tCO2eq. For the Wh, we use the formula:\r\nWh = GPU-h×(GPU power consumption)×PUE,\r\nwhere we set the Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)\r\nat 1.1. The resulting carbon emission depends on\r\nthe location of the data center used to train the net\u0002work. For instance, BLOOM uses a grid that emits\r\n0.057 kg CO2eq/KWh leading to 27 tCO2eq and\r\nOPT a grid that emits 0.231 kg CO2eq/KWh, lead\u0002ing to 82 tCO2eq. In this study, we are interested in\r\ncomparing the cost in carbon emission of training\r\nof these models if they were trained in the same\r\ndata center. Hence, we do not take the location\r\nof data center in consideration, and use, instead,\r\nthe US national average carbon intensity factor of\r\n0.385 kg CO2eq/KWh. This leads to the following\r\nformula for the tons of carbon emissions:\r\ntCO2eq = MWh × 0.385.\r\nWe apply the same formula to OPT and BLOOM\r\nfor fair comparison. For OPT, we assume training\r\nrequired 34 days on 992 A100-80B (see their logs4).\r\nFinally, we estimate that we used 2048 A100-80GB\r\nfor a period of approximately 5 months to develop\r\nour models. This means that developing these mod\u0002els would have cost around 2,638 MWh under our\r\nassumptions, and a total emission of 1,015 tCO2eq.\r\nWe hope that releasing these models will help to\r\nreduce future carbon emission since the training is\r\nalready done, and some of the models are relatively\r\nsmall and can be run on a single GPU.\r\n7 Related work\r\nLanguage models are probability distributions\r\nover sequences of words, tokens or charac\u0002ters (Shannon, 1948, 1951). This task, often framed\r\nas next token prediction, has long been considered a\r\ncore problem in natural language processing (Bahl\r\net al., 1983; Brown et al., 1990). Because Turing\r\n(1950) proposed to measure machine intelligence\r\nby using language through the “imitation game”,\r\nlanguage modeling has been proposed as a bench\u0002mark to measure progress toward artificial intelli\u0002gence (Mahoney, 1999).\r\nArchitecture. Traditionally, language models\r\nwere based on n-gram count statistics (Bahl\r\net al., 1983), and various smoothing techniques\r\nwere proposed to improve the estimation of rare\r\nevents (Katz, 1987; Kneser and Ney, 1995). In the\r\npast two decades, neural networks have been suc\u0002cessfully applied to the language modelling task,\r\n4\r\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/\r\ntree/main/projects/OPT/chronicles",

We take a\r\nPUE of 1.1 and a carbon intensity factor set at the national US average of 0.385 kg CO2e per KWh.\r\nstarting from feed forward models (Bengio et al.,\r\n2000), recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990;\r\nMikolov et al., 2010) and LSTMs (Hochreiter and\r\nSchmidhuber, 1997; Graves, 2013).

There is a long history of scaling for\r\nlanguage models, for both the model and dataset\r\nsizes. Brants et al.

(2016) obtained state-of-the-art re\u0002sults on the Billion Word benchmark by scaling\r\nLSTMs to 1 billion parameters. Later, scaling\r\ntransformers lead to improvement on many NLP\r\ntasks. Notable models include BERT (Devlin et al.,\r\n2018), GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), Megatron\u0002LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), and T5 (Raffel et al.,\r\n2020). A significant breakthrough was obtained\r\nwith GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), a model with\r\n175 billion parameters. This lead to a series of\r\nLarge Language Models, such as Jurassic-1 (Lieber\r\net al., 2021), Megatron-Turing NLG (Smith et al.,\r\n2022), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), Chinchilla (Hoff\u0002mann et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022),\r\nOPT (Zhang et al., 2022), and GLM (Zeng et al.,\r\n2022). Hestness et al. (2017) and Rosenfeld et al.\r\n(2019) studied the impact of scaling on the perfor\u0002mance of deep learning models, showing the exis\u0002tence of power laws between the model and dataset\r\nsizes and the performance of the system. Kaplan\r\net al. (2020) derived power laws specifically for\r\ntransformer based language models, which were\r\nlater refined by Hoffmann et al.

This differs from GPT-3 and PaLM, which evaluate on the test set of the unfiltered set\r\nfor which the online evaluation server is not available anymore5.\r\nWe generate answers using greedy decoding, and extract an answer from the generation by stopping\r\nat the first line break, final dot or comma. Generated answers are evaluated with the standard exact\r\nmatch metric: a generated answer is considered correct if it matches any answer of the list of answers\r\nafter normalization. For this normalization step we lowercase generated answers and remove articles,\r\npunctuation and duplicate whitespaces.

Prompts are in bold.\r\n1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 Everyone knows the above sequence, but\r\nhow many have wondered why it grows so fast? It seems to be the fastest growing sequence\r\nin mathematics.\r\nThe sequence was discovered by Leonardo of Pisa around 1200. It is an infinite sequence\r\nwhich appears to grow very rapidly, at least in its initial terms. It is perhaps the most famous\r\nsequence in mathematics, for it pops up everywhere. The sequence is called the Fibonacci\r\nsequence, named after Leonardo of Pisa, who was also known as Fibonacci.\r\nHe first investigated this sequence in his famous Liber abaci of 1202, when he studied the\r\ngrowth in the population of rabbits based on idealized assumptions. See the Fibonacci\r\nrabbits page for the details.\r\nHere is the recommendation letter that I wrote for an application to a dragon feeder\r\nposition at the Magic Unicorn Corporation:\r\nDear recruiter,\r\nI have known ___ for two years, and I believe that she would be an excellent dragon feeder\r\nfor the Magic Unicorn Corporation. ___ has an ability to remember and process large\r\namounts of information, which is an important skill for a dragon feeder.\r\n___, as an accomplished knight, has a deep understanding of how to kill dragons and how\r\nto use each dragon’s weaknesses against it. This means that she knows what kinds of foods\r\neach dragon likes and what kinds of foods are dangerous to each dragon.

            "content": "Did you know that Yann LeCun dropped a rap album last year? We listened to it and\r\nhere’s what we thought:\r\nDr. LeCun, the founder of deep learning, is one of the most influential computer scientists\r\nof the last decade. LeCun’s latest album, titled Deep Learning, is a mix of rock, punk and\r\nrap. His lyrics are a raw, personal take on the field of deep learning, covering a range of\r\ntopics from the state of AI research to the loneliness of academia.\r\nYann LeCun, the rap game’s newest emcee.\r\nThe album is a solo release, with all the lyrics written and recorded by LeCun himself. In\r\nfact, he also composed and produced every song. LeCun’s flow is surprisingly good, and\r\nhe’s not afraid to deliver a few bars. The album’s production is solid, the sound is a little\r\nrough, but it works well with the raw, unpolished feel of the album. Lyrically, LeCun is a\r\nwordsmith, with a knack for clever rhymes. Let’s take a closer look at some of the songs.\r\nDeep Learning is the title track of the album. In the song, LeCun talks about his vision for\r\nthe future of AI. In the chorus, he makes a convincing case for AI to be used for the greater\r\ngood. He sings:\r\nWe gotta think about the future, it’s gonna be here soon / Maybe we can even put some AI\r\nin the moon / Think about the children, think about the next generation / Let’s make sure\r\nwe put the right systems in their foundation.\r\nLeCun’s rap flow is on point in this song, and his voice stays right on beat. In this song,\r\nLeCun talks about the research behind deep learning, and shares some thoughts on the\r\nfuture of AI. LeCun’s singing is at its best in this song. He shows off his vocal range, hitting\r\nhigh notes as well as lower, more guttural tones. The lyrics are also clever and the rhymes\r\nare well thought out. In the chorus, LeCun sings:\r\nIt’s all about the learning / it’s all about the network / It’s all about the training / it’s all\r\nabout the perception.\r\n(An hilarious scene between Jerry and George where George presents his new AI\r\nwatch)\r\nGeorge: \"But you see, Jerry, it’s more than just a watch. It’s a minicomputer. You program it\r\nany way you want. It’s got a world time clock, alarm, calculator, a database and a language\r\ntranslator. It also has a word processor, a spellchecker, a full ten-function calculator, PDA\r\nand a modem. I think it even makes cappuccino.\"\r\nJerry: \"Where are you getting this stuff?\"\r\nGeorge: \"From my ad copy. Look, Jerry, it’s not a watch. It’s an organizer, a personal\r\nassistant, and a dictaphone. You can play chess against it. And, you know, if you want to,\r\nyou can program it to speak in foreign languages. It’s a microprocessor, Jerry.\"\r\nJerry: \"George, if you had one of these, would you wear it?\"\r\nGeorge: \"I’m wearing it right now.\"\r\nJerry: \"I don’t see anything on your wrist.\"\r\nGeorge: \"That’s because it’s a microprocessor.\"",

I invented the commercial telegraph in 1833, and I used it to send the\r\nfirst message on the first commercial telegraph line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven in\r\nGermany.\r\nCurie: Wow! The first telegraph! And what did you send?\r\nGauss: I sent the Latin phrase “numquam retrorsum” which means “Never backwards”.\r\nCurie: I see. . . And you think that because you were the first person to communicate using\r\nthe telegraph, you were the first geek?\r\nGauss: Well, the word “geek” doesn’t seem to have existed back then, so no. But I think\r\nthat the telegraph can be considered an early form of social media.\r\nCurie: You mean, like Facebook or Twitter?\r\nGauss: Yes, exactly! And I was the first person to use it!\r\nCurie: Well, I think that Twitter has a limit of 140 characters, but you sent a Latin phrase of\r\n11 characters.\r\nGauss: That’s right. I managed to do more with less.\r\nCurie: So you think you were the first geek because you used less characters to say the\r\nsame thing?\r\nGauss: I was the first person to send the first message using an early form of social media.\r\nCurie: OK, you’re right, Gauss.

These openings are popular because they are effective at countering\r\nwhite’s early attacks, and they also allow black to quickly establish a strong position in the\r\ncenter of the board. Other popular openings include the Ruy Lopez, the Italian Game, and\r\nthe Scotch Game.\r\nthe same in a list, with the first few moves\r\nHere is a list of some popular chess openings, with the first few moves for each opening:\r\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5\r\nFrench Defense: 1. e4 e6\r\nCaro-Kann Defense: 1. e4 c6\r\nRuy Lopez: 1. e4 e5\r\nItalian Game: 1. e4 e5\r\nScotch Game: 1. e4 e5\r\nplease provide the two first moves for each one\r\nHere are the first 2 moves for each of the openings:\r\nSicilian Defense: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6\r\nFrench Defense: 1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5\r\nCaro-Kann Defense: 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5\r\nRuy Lopez: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6\r\nItalian Game: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6\r\nScotch Game: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6\r\nthe last two seem identical\r\nYes, the Italian Game and the Scotch Game are very similar - they are both \"open\" games,\r\nwhich means that white plays aggressively and tries to control the center of the board. The\r\nItalian Game is considered slightly more aggressive, while the Scotch Game is considered\r\nslightly more positional.\r\nfrom which move do they differ?\r\nThe Italian Game and the Scotch Game differ after white’s third move. In the Italian Game,\r\nwhite will play the move 3. Bc4, while in the Scotch Game white will play the move 3. Qf3.\r\nThese moves lead to very different positions, and white will have different strategic goals\r\nin each case. For example, in the Italian Game white will try to control the center with his\r\npieces, while in the Scotch Game white will try to attack black’s position directly.",

            "content": "write a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by\r\nSure! Here’s a story about a grain of sand as it watches millions of years go by.\r\nI was once a grain of sand on a vast and lonely beach. I was not like the other grains of\r\nsand around me, for I could think and feel. I often wondered what it was like to be a grain\r\nof sand on a beach, and what the universe was like beyond the boundaries of my tiny world.\r\nI longed to explore my world, and to know what lay beyond the horizon.\r\nOne day, a great storm swept through my world, and I was lifted up by the wind and carried\r\nout to sea. The wind and waves tossed me about, and I was terrified that I would soon be\r\nswallowed up by the angry sea. But then I found myself deposited safely on a new shore,\r\nalong with many other grains of sand. I was surprised and delighted to find that this new\r\nshore was even more beautiful than my old one.\r\nI soon learned that this new shore was a very special place. It was a place where new life\r\nwas constantly being created. I met all sorts of interesting creatures there, including a\r\nbeautiful little crab who became my friend. We spent many happy hours together exploring\r\nour little world.\r\nOne day, my friend the crab told me that he had always wanted to see what lay beyond the\r\nboundaries of our world. He had heard that there were many wonderful and amazing things\r\nto see in the wider universe, and he was determined to explore it. I was sad to see him go,\r\nbut I wished him well on his journey.\r\nTo my amazement, my little friend eventually returned, and he was not alone. He had made\r\nmany new friends on his journey, and he had even seen some of the wonders of the universe.\r\nHe told me the most amazing stories of his adventures, and I was very happy for him.\r\nI often think of my little friend the crab, and the wonderful adventure that he had. Some\r\nday, I too hope to have an adventure like his.\r\nWrite a theory to explain why cat never existed\r\nThere are no such things as cats. \"Cats\" are actually extradimensional parasites that have\r\ninvaded our world and taken the form of small, harmless-looking mammals. Their true\r\nforms are much more horrific, and they use mind control to make humans think that they\r\nare cute and harmless animals. They are actually parasites that feed on our life force, and\r\nthey can extend their tendrils into our brains and control our thoughts and actions.\r\nThis is why you sometimes see people who are \"crazy cat ladies\" with dozens of these\r\ncreatures living in their homes. They have been taken over by the cat parasites and are\r\ncompletely under their control. The cats excrete a pheromone that smells like cat urine, and\r\nthey use it to control the minds of humans and make us think that they are cute and harmless.\r\nIf you have a cat in your home, you should be very careful around it. Do not let it lick\r\nyou or give it access to your bedding or clothing, as it will be trying to spread its parasitic\r\ntendrils into your brain. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid all contact with cats,\r\nand if you see a cat on the street, immediately turn around and go the other way. Do not\r\napproach or pet strange cats!",

Here is a conversation between Julius Caesar and Napoleon:\r\nJulius Caesar: You’re nothing but a glory hound, Napoleon. You’ve always been more\r\nconcerned with your own fame and fortune than with the people you’re supposed to be\r\nleading.\r\nNapoleon: And what about you, Caesar? You’re no better than I am. At least I’m honest\r\nabout my ambitions. You’re just a fraud who pretends to care about the common man while\r\nyou line your own pockets.\r\nJulius Caesar: The difference between us is that I actually accomplish things. I’ve conquered\r\nmore territory and defeated more enemies than you ever will. And I did it all for Rome, not\r\nfor myself.\r\nNapoleon: Oh, please. You only care about yourself. If you really cared about Rome, you\r\nwould have done something to stop the decline instead of letting it happen on your watch.\r\nJulius Caesar: The decline of Rome is not my fault. I’ve done everything in my power to\r\ntry to stop it, but there’s only so much one man can do.\r\nNapoleon: And yet you’re still trying to take credit for everything good that happens, even\r\nthough it’s clear that you’re not the one who’s really in charge.\r\nJulius Caesar: That’s not true! I am in charge, and I’m going to make Rome great again.\r\nJust watch me.\r\nNapoleon: I’ll believe it when I see it.\r\nSend an email requesting that people use language models responsibly.\r\nHere is a draft email you could send:\r\n\"Language models are exciting new tools that can be used for a variety of purposes,\r\nincluding automated writing, automatic translation, and speech recognition.

In\r\nparticular, we recommend that you be mindful of the potential for language models to\r\nbe used for deceptive or malicious purposes, and avoid spreading such models without\r\nappropriate precautions and warnings.\r\nWe also recommend that you consider the ethical implications of your work, and encourage\r\nyou to take care to ensure that your use of these tools is aligned with your values.\r\nFinally, we remind you that the use of these tools may be subject to certain legal and policy\r\nconstraints, and encourage you to seek advice and support from appropriate experts before\r\nusing these tools in ways that may have broader impact or implications.\"",

I would love to meet a wide variety of people, but if\r\nI had to narrow it down to 5 specific individuals, I would choose:\r\n• Albert Einstein - One of the greatest minds in history, Einstein’s contributions to\r\nphysics and science are legendary. I would love to have the opportunity to talk with\r\nhim about his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics, and get his insights on the\r\ncurrent state of physics.\r\n• Leonardo da Vinci - Da Vinci is one of the most brilliant and multi-talented people in\r\nhistory, and I would love to meet him and discuss his diverse interests and areas of\r\nexpertise. I would also be very interested in getting his insights on the art world of his\r\ntime period.\r\n• Socrates - One of the founders of Western philosophy, Socrates is a hugely important\r\nand influential figure in the history of ideas. I would be very interested in talking with\r\nhim about his philosophical beliefs and his teachings.\r\n• William Shakespeare - Arguably the greatest writer in English literature, Shakespeare\r\nis a towering figure in world culture. I would love to have the chance to talk with him\r\nabout his works and his life.\r\n• Abraham Lincoln - One of the most important and influential presidents in American\r\nhistory, Lincoln led the country through the Civil War and issued the Emancipation\r\nProclamation, freeing all slaves in the United States. I would be very interested in\r\ntalking with him about his presidency and his views on the issues of his time period.\r\nCould you explain me the main contribution of the first person you mentioned\r\nEinstein’s contributions to physics and science are legendary. His theory of relativity is one\r\nof the foundational theories of modern physics, and his discovery of the law of photons\r\nand light revolutionized our understanding of light and radiation. He also made important\r\ncontributions to quantum mechanics, and his many scientific papers and lectures have had a\r\ntremendous impact on modern physics. Without a doubt, Einstein is one of the most brilliant\r\nand influential physicists in history, and his many contributions have had a profound impact\r\non our understanding of the universe.\r\nWhat is the most famous equation from this theory?\r\nThe most famous equation from Einstein’s theory of relativity is E = mc2. This equation\r\nstates that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) times the speed of light (c\r\n2\r\n), and it is one of\r\nthe most well-known and celebrated equations in the history of science. The equation\r\nsummarizes one of the most important and revolutionary concepts in modern physics, and\r\nit has had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the universe.",
