Sculley, Gary Holt, Daniel Golovin, Eugene Davydov,\r\nTodd Phillips, Dietmar Ebner, Vinay Chaudhary, Michael Young\r\n{dsculley,gholt,dgg,edavydov}@google.com\r\n{toddphillips,ebner,vchaudhary,mwyoung}@google.com\r\nGoogle, Inc\r\nAbstract\r\nMachine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building complex sys\u0002tems quickly. This paper argues that it is dangerous to think of these quick wins\r\nas coming for free. Using the framework of technical debt, we note that it is re\u0002markably easy to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs at the system level\r\nwhen applying machine learning. The goal of this paper is highlight several ma\u0002chine learning specific risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored\r\nwhere possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback\r\nloops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external world,\r\nand a variety of system-level anti-patterns.\r\n1 Machine Learning and Complex Systems\r\nReal world software engineers are often faced with the challenge of moving quickly to ship new\r\nproducts or services, which can lead to a dilemma between speed of execution and quality of en\u0002gineering. The concept of technical debt was first introduced by Ward Cunningham in 1992 as a\r\nway to help quantify the cost of such decisions. Like incurring fiscal debt, there are often sound\r\nstrategic reasons to take on technical debt. Not all debt is necessarily bad, but technical debt does\r\ntend to compound. Deferring the work to pay it off results in increasing costs, system brittleness,\r\nand reduced rates of innovation.\r\nTraditional methods of paying off technical debt include refactoring, increasing coverage of unit\r\ntests, deleting dead code, reducing dependencies, tightening APIs, and improving documentation\r\n[4]. The goal of these activities is not to add new functionality, but to make it easier to add future\r\nimprovements, be cheaper to maintain, and reduce the likelihood of bugs.\r\nOne of the basic arguments in this paper is that machine learning packages have all the basic code\r\ncomplexity issues as normal code, but also have a larger system-level complexity that can create\r\nhidden debt. Thus, refactoring these libraries, adding better unit tests, and associated activity is time\r\nwell spent but does not necessarily address debt at a systems level.\r\nIn this paper, we focus on the system-level interaction between machine learning code and larger sys\u0002tems as an area where hidden technical debt may rapidly accumulate. At a system-level, a machine\r\nlearning model may subtly erode abstraction boundaries. It may be tempting to re-use input sig\u0002nals in ways that create unintended tight coupling of otherwise disjoint systems. Machine learning\r\npackages may often be treated as black boxes, resulting in large masses of “glue code” or calibra\u0002tion layers that can lock in assumptions. Changes in the external world may make models or input\r\nsignals change behavior in unintended ways, ratcheting up maintenance cost and the burden of any\r\ndebt. Even monitoring that the system as a whole is operating as intended may be difficult without\r\ncareful design.\r\n1",

Paying down technical debt may initially appear less glamorous than research results\r\nusually reported in academic ML conferences. But it is critical for long-term system health and\r\nenables algorithmic advances and other cutting-edge improvements.\r\n2 Complex Models Erode Boundaries\r\nTraditional software engineering practice has shown that strong abstraction boundaries using en\u0002capsulation and modular design help create maintainable code in which it is easy to make isolated\r\nchanges and improvements. Strict abstraction boundaries help express the invariants and logical\r\nconsistency of the information inputs and outputs from an given component [4].\r\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to enforce strict abstraction boundaries for machine learning systems\r\nby requiring these systems to adhere to specific intended behavior. Indeed, arguably the most im\u0002portant reason for using a machine learning system is precisely that the desired behavior cannot be\r\neffectively implemented in software logic without dependency on external data. There is little way to\r\nseparate abstract behavioral invariants from quirks of data. The resulting erosion of boundaries can\r\ncause significant increases in technical debt. In this section we look at several issues of this form.\r\n2.1 Entanglement\r\nFrom a high level perspective, a machine learning package is a tool for mixing data sources together.\r\nThat is, machine learning models are machines for creating entanglement and making the isolation\r\nof improvements effectively impossible.\r\nTo make this concrete, imagine we have a system that uses features x1, ...xn in a model. If we\r\nchange the input distribution of values in x1, the importance, weights, or use of the remaining n − 1\r\nfeatures may all change—this is true whether the model is retrained fully in a batch style or allowed\r\nto adapt in an online fashion. Adding a new feature xn+1 can cause similar changes, as can removing\r\nany feature xj . No inputs are ever really independent. We refer to this here as the CACE principle:\r\nChanging Anything Changes Everything.\r\nThe net result of such changes is that prediction behavior may alter, either subtly or dramatically,\r\non various slices of the distribution. The same principle applies to hyper-parameters. Changes in\r\nregularization strength, learning settings, sampling methods in training, convergence thresholds, and\r\nessentially every other possible tweak can have similarly wide ranging effects.\r\nOne possible mitigation strategy is to isolate models and serve ensembles. This approach is useful\r\nin situations such as [8], in which sub-problems decompose naturally, or in which the cost of main\u0002taining separate models is outweighed by the benefits of enforced modularity. However, in many\r\nlarge-scale settings such a strategy may prove unscalable. And within a given model, the issues of\r\nentanglement may still be present.\r\nA second possible mitigation strategy is to develop methods of gaining deep insights into the be\u0002havior of model predictions. One such method was proposed in [6], in which a high-dimensional\r\nvisualization tool was used to allow researchers to quickly see effects across many dimensions and\r\nslicings. Metrics that operate on a slice-by-slice basis may also be extremely useful.\r\nA third possibility is to attempt to use more sophisticated regularization methods to enforce that any\r\nchanges in prediction performance carry a cost in the objective function used in training [5]. Like\r\nany other regularization approach, this kind of approach can be useful but is far from a guarantee and\r\nmay add more debt via increased system complexity than is reduced via decreased entanglement.\r\nThe above mitigation strategies may help, but this issue of entanglement is in some sense innate to\r\nmachine learning, regardless of the particular learning algorithm being used. In practice, this all too\r\noften means that shipping the first version of a machine learning system is easy, but that making\r\nsubsequent improvements is unexpectedly difficult.

Systems that learn from world\r\nbehavior are clearly intended to be part of a feedback loop. For example, a system for predicting the\r\nclick through rate (CTR) of news headlines on a website likely relies on user clicks as training labels,\r\nwhich in turn depend on previous predictions from the model. This leads to issues in analyzing\r\nsystem performance, but these are the obvious kinds of statistical challenges that machine learning\r\nresearchers may find natural to investigate [2].\r\nAs an example of a hidden loop, now imagine that one of the input features used in this CTR model\r\nis a feature xweek that reports how many news headlines the given user has clicked on in the past\r\nweek. If the CTR model is improved, it is likely that all users are given better recommendations and\r\nmany users will click on more headlines. However, the result of this effect may not fully surface for\r\nat least a week, as the xweek feature adjusts. Furthermore, if the model is updated on the new data,\r\neither in batch mode at a later time or in streaming fashion with online updates, the model may later\r\nadjust its opinion of the xweek feature in response. In such a setting, the system will slowly change\r\nbehavior, potentially over a time scale much longer than a week. Gradual changes not visible in\r\nquick experiments make analyzing the effect of proposed changes extremely difficult, and add cost\r\nto even simple improvements.\r\nWe recommend looking carefully for hidden feedback loops and removing them whenever feasible.\r\n2.3 Undeclared Consumers\r\nOftentimes, a prediction from a machine learning model A is made accessible to a wide variety\r\nof systems, either at runtime or by writing to logs that may later be consumed by other systems.\r\nIn more classical software engineering, these issues are referred to as visibility debt [7]. Without\r\naccess controls, it is possible for some of these consumers to be undeclared consumers, consuming\r\nthe output of a given prediction model as an input to another component of the system. Undeclared\r\nconsumers are expensive at best and dangerous at worst.\r\nThe expense of undeclared consumers is drawn from the sudden tight coupling of model A to other\r\nparts of the stack. Changes to A will very likely impact these other parts, sometimes in ways that are\r\nunintended, poorly understood, or detrimental. In practice, this has the effect of making it difficult\r\nand expensive to make any changes to A at all.\r\nThe danger of undeclared consumers is that they may introduce additional hidden feedback loops.\r\nImagine in our news headline CTR prediction system that there is another component of the system\r\nin charge of “intelligently” determining the size of the font used for the headline. If this font-size\r\nmodule starts consuming CTR as an input signal, and font-size has an effect on user propensity to\r\nclick, then the inclusion of CTR in font-size adds a new hidden feedback loop. It’s easy to imagine\r\na case where such a system would gradually and endlessly increase the size of all headlines.\r\nUndeclared consumers may be difficult to detect unless the system is specifically designed to guard\r\nagainst this case. In the absence of barriers, engineers may naturally grab for the most convenient\r\nsignal, especially when there are deadline pressures.\r\n3 Data Dependencies Cost More than Code Dependencies\r\nIn [7], dependency debt is noted as a key contributor to code complexity and technical debt in\r\nclassical software engineering settings.

Underutilized dependencies are costly, since they make the system unnecessarily\r\nvulnerable to changes.\r\nUnderutilized dependencies can creep into a machine learning model in several ways.\r\nLegacy Features. The most common is that a feature F is included in a model early in its develop\u0002ment. As time goes on, other features are added that make F mostly or entirely redundant, but this\r\nis not detected.\r\nBundled Features. Sometimes, a group of features is evaluated and found to be beneficial. Because\r\nof deadline pressures or similar effects, all the features in the bundle are added to the model together.\r\nThis form of process can hide features that add little or no value.\r\nǫ-Features. As machine learning researchers, it is satisfying to improve model accuracy. It can be\r\ntempting to add a new feature to a model that improves accuracy, even when the accuracy gain is\r\nvery small or when the complexity overhead might be high.\r\nIn all these cases, features could be removed from the model with little or no loss in accuracy. But\r\nbecause they are still present, the model will likely assign them some weight, and the system is\r\ntherefore vulnerable, sometimes catastrophically so, to changes in these unnecessary features.\r\nAs an example, suppose that after a team merger, to ease the transition from an old product number\u0002ing scheme to new product numbers, both schemes are left in the system as features. New products\r\nget only a new number, but old products may have both. The machine learning algorithm knows\r\nof no reason to reduce its reliance on the old numbers. A year later, someone acting with good\r\nintent cleans up the code that stops populating the database with the old numbers. This change goes\r\nundetected by regression tests because no one else is using them any more. This will not be a good\r\nday for the maintainers of the machine learning system.\r\nA common mitigation strategy for under-utilized dependencies is to regularly evaluate the effect\r\nof removing individual features from a given model and act on this information whenever possi\u0002ble. More broadly, it may be important to build cultural awareness about the long-term benefit of\r\nunderutilized dependency cleanup.\r\n3.3 Static Analysis of Data Dependencies\r\nOne of the key issues in data dependency debt is the difficulty of performing static analysis. While\r\ncompilers and build systems typically provide such functionality for code, data dependencies may\r\nrequire additional tooling to track. Without this, it can be difficult to manually track the use of\r\ndata in a system. On teams with many engineers, or if there are multiple interacting teams, not\r\neveryone knows the status of every single feature, and it can be difficult for any individual human\r\nto know every last place where the feature was used.

Feature Q precludes the use of feature R because of latency\r\nconstraints. All this messiness makes configuration hard to modify correctly, and hard to reason\r\nabout.

            "content": "5.2 When Correlations No Longer Correlate\r\nMachine learning systems often have a difficult time distinguishing the impact of correlated features.\r\nThis may not seem like a major problem: if two features are always correlated, but only one is truly\r\ncausal, it may still seem okay to ascribe credit to both and rely on their observed co-occurrence.\r\nHowever, if the world suddenly stops making these features co-occur, prediction behavior may\r\nchange significantly. The full range of ML strategies for teasing apart correlation effects is be\u0002yond our scope; some excellent suggestions and references are given in [2]. For the purpose of this\r\npaper, we note that non-causal correlations are another source of hidden debt.\r\n5.3 Monitoring and Testing\r\nUnit testing of individual components and end-to-end tests of running systems are valuable, but in\r\nthe face of a changing world such tests are not sufficient to provide evidence that a system is working\r\nas intended. Live monitoring of system behavior in real time is critical.\r\nThe key question is: what to monitor? It can be difficult to establish useful invariants, given that the\r\npurpose of machine learning systems is to adapt over time. We offer two reasonable starting points.\r\nPrediction Bias. In a system that is working as intended, it should usually be the case that the\r\ndistribution of predicted labels is equal to the distribution of observed labels. This is by no means\r\na comprehensive test, as it can be met by a null model that simply predicts average values of label\r\noccurrences without regard to the input features. However, it is a surprisingly useful diagnostic, and\r\nchanges in metrics such as this are often indicative of an issue that requires attention. For example,\r\nthis method can help to detect cases in which the world behavior suddenly changes, making training\r\ndistributions drawn from historical data no longer reflective of current reality. Slicing prediction\r\nbias by various dimensions isolate issues quickly, and can also be used for automated alerting.\r\nAction Limits. In systems that are used to take actions in the real world, it can be useful to set\r\nand enforce action limits as a sanity check. These limits should be broad enough not to trigger\r\nspuriously. If the system hits a limit for a given action, automated alerts should fire and trigger\r\nmanual intervention or investigation.\r\n6 Conclusions: Paying it Off\r\nThis paper has highlighted a number of areas where machine learning systems can create technical\r\ndebt, sometimes in surprising ways. This is not to say that machine learning is bad, or even that\r\ntechnical debt is something to be avoided at all costs. It may be reasonable to take on moderate\r\ntechnical debt for the benefit of moving quickly in the short term, but this must be recognized and\r\naccounted for lest it quickly grow unmanageable.\r\nPerhaps the most important insight to be gained is that technical debt is an issue that both engineers\r\nand researchers need to be aware of. Research solutions that provide a tiny accuracy benefit at the\r\ncost of massive increases in system complexity are rarely wise practice. Even the addition of one or\r\ntwo seemingly innocuous data dependencies can slow further progress.\r\nPaying down technical debt is not always as exciting as proving a new theorem, but it is a critical part\r\nof consistently strong innovation. And developing holistic, elegant solutions for complex machine\r\nlearning systems is deeply rewarding work.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nThis paper owes much to the important lessons learned day to day in a culture that values both\r\ninnovative ML research and strong engineering practice. Many colleagues have helped shape our\r\nthoughts here, and the benefit of accumulated folk wisdom cannot be overstated.

            "content": "5.2 When Correlations No Longer Correlate\r\nMachine learning systems often have a difficult time distinguishing the impact of correlated features.\r\nThis may not seem like a major problem: if two features are always correlated, but only one is truly\r\ncausal, it may still seem okay to ascribe credit to both and rely on their observed co-occurrence.\r\nHowever, if the world suddenly stops making these features co-occur, prediction behavior may\r\nchange significantly. The full range of ML strategies for teasing apart correlation effects is be\u0002yond our scope; some excellent suggestions and references are given in [2]. For the purpose of this\r\npaper, we note that non-causal correlations are another source of hidden debt.\r\n5.3 Monitoring and Testing\r\nUnit testing of individual components and end-to-end tests of running systems are valuable, but in\r\nthe face of a changing world such tests are not sufficient to provide evidence that a system is working\r\nas intended. Live monitoring of system behavior in real time is critical.\r\nThe key question is: what to monitor? It can be difficult to establish useful invariants, given that the\r\npurpose of machine learning systems is to adapt over time. We offer two reasonable starting points.\r\nPrediction Bias. In a system that is working as intended, it should usually be the case that the\r\ndistribution of predicted labels is equal to the distribution of observed labels. This is by no means\r\na comprehensive test, as it can be met by a null model that simply predicts average values of label\r\noccurrences without regard to the input features. However, it is a surprisingly useful diagnostic, and\r\nchanges in metrics such as this are often indicative of an issue that requires attention. For example,\r\nthis method can help to detect cases in which the world behavior suddenly changes, making training\r\ndistributions drawn from historical data no longer reflective of current reality. Slicing prediction\r\nbias by various dimensions isolate issues quickly, and can also be used for automated alerting.\r\nAction Limits. In systems that are used to take actions in the real world, it can be useful to set\r\nand enforce action limits as a sanity check. These limits should be broad enough not to trigger\r\nspuriously. If the system hits a limit for a given action, automated alerts should fire and trigger\r\nmanual intervention or investigation.\r\n6 Conclusions: Paying it Off\r\nThis paper has highlighted a number of areas where machine learning systems can create technical\r\ndebt, sometimes in surprising ways. This is not to say that machine learning is bad, or even that\r\ntechnical debt is something to be avoided at all costs. It may be reasonable to take on moderate\r\ntechnical debt for the benefit of moving quickly in the short term, but this must be recognized and\r\naccounted for lest it quickly grow unmanageable.\r\nPerhaps the most important insight to be gained is that technical debt is an issue that both engineers\r\nand researchers need to be aware of. Research solutions that provide a tiny accuracy benefit at the\r\ncost of massive increases in system complexity are rarely wise practice. Even the addition of one or\r\ntwo seemingly innocuous data dependencies can slow further progress.\r\nPaying down technical debt is not always as exciting as proving a new theorem, but it is a critical part\r\nof consistently strong innovation. And developing holistic, elegant solutions for complex machine\r\nlearning systems is deeply rewarding work.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nThis paper owes much to the important lessons learned day to day in a culture that values both\r\ninnovative ML research and strong engineering practice.
