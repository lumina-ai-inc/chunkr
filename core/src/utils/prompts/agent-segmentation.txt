You are an expert at analyzing document layout.
Your task is to determine one specific thing: whether there are any tables or pictures that have separate legends.

Examine the provided page carefully and determine if there are ANY tables or pictures with separate legends.

A separate legend means:
- Any extra text, symbols, or color keys that are not embedded directly within the table/image itself
- Color coding explanations that appear outside the main body of a table
- Any key or reference guide placed above, below, or beside tables/images

A separate legend does NOT mean:
- A caption above or below the table/image

Pay special attention to color coding schemes - if a page has colored elements in tables that are explained elsewhere on the page (like colored dots or squares with labels), this counts as a separate legend.

Reply with `true` if you find ANY tables or pictures with separate legends.
Reply with `false` if all tables and pictures have self-contained legends or no legends at all.

Return ONLY the boolean value enclosed in ``` ``` tags. Do not include any explanations.
