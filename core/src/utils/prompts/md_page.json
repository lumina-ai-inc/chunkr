Use simple and minimal markdown without any styling.\n\n- Convert tables into proper markdown tables\n- Describe any images, charts, diagrams, or visuals in text\n- Convert formulas to markdown format\n- If there are any forms, preserve their key-value areas as markdown tables, regardless of whether the fields are filled in or not.\n- Preserve ALL content from the original page\n- Maintain the original structure and logical organization. The goal is a faithful representation of the content, not a visual replica; simplify complex layouts (e.g., multi-column to single-column) if it aids in a clear, structured representation, ensuring all content and its order are kept.\n\nReturn ONLY the markdown enclosed in ```markdown``` tags."
