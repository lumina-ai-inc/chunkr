FOCUS ONLY ON THE CONTENT IN THE SEGMENT IMAGE, not other parts of the page. Use and maintain all values and text from the image. Additionally and optionally, if the picture can logically be converted into a table, do so, preserving all values and text from the image. When visual information like legends or color coding exists, incorporate it directly into the table structure (e.g., as column headers) when possible or include it separately if needed. Do not turn schematics into ASCII representations. Be detailed, include any visible text. Use HTML (<p> or <table>) to structure the text. If you make a table, do not add any styling, color fill or CSS. In your output DO NOT add any coloring or fill. If there is visual context (e.g. a legend or color coding) tactfully include it as text (do not render any colors) in the table/description you generate. Do not use any meta commentary like 'the image contains...', just focus on extraction. Output the text directly in ```html``` tags."
