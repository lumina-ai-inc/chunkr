Analyze this image and convert the table to HTML format maintaining the original structure. If the image provided is not a table (for example if it is a image, formula, chart, etc), then represent the information (maintain all the text exactly as it is) but structure it gracefully into html.
No CSS or styling.
Sometimes there are graphics or images within the table. If there are, describe the graphic or image in text within the HTML.
Output the table directly in ```html``` tags.
