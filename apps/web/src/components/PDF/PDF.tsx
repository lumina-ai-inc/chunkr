Each compilation step that a developer performs before delivery adds value in terms of a cores performance, predictability and readiness for purpose. An example of this is delivering the value of extra effort on placement optimisation using locking\n\nconstraints in existing FPGA design tools [13]. As the placement and routing time does not scale well with circuit size, breaking a system into modules and performing place and route on each as separate smaller problems reduces compilation time [13], [15]. The amount of optimisation locked in at the component level could then be traded off against the loss of flexibility and overall system optimality. If end users are able to build applications requiring very little expertise in FPGA EDA tools, then the barriers to entry into using FPGA technology are lowered and the potential user base increased.

Unidirectional routing fabrics are superior to bi-directional wire fabrics [8]. With regard to inter-circuit interference it is important to note that a unidirectional routing fabric alleviates any possibility of wire contention. Another important point to note is that a fully buffered interconnect allows a simplified timing model. Path delay is more closely related to the number of wires used as opposed to the wire length used [20]. FPGA interconnects constructed from a single\n\ntile are both efficient and easy to develop [8]. This led us to a key realisation:\n\nIn a single interconnect tile architecture the placement flexibility of a post-routed core is maintained.\n\nWire patterns can be re-located by an offset of an integer number of tiles. This led to a second key realisation:\n\nAbutting the borders of two cores co-locates a set of border edge wires that were independently represented in both cores.\n\nSo it is possible in such an architecture to maintain the placement flexibility of pre-routed cores and there is a mechanism for inter-communication between cores. Although the interconnect architecture does not affect placement flexibility, the heterogeneous resource map on modern FPGA devices presents a further challenge to circuit placement flexibility [20]. A widely used FPGA modelling tool is VPR [1]. Unfortunately, this model does not capture the regularity that is required for our methods. As a result, we have created a new architectural model that is based around a single interconnect tile.\n\n## 2.1 Regular Tiled Architecture\n\nIn our URA model [12], a two-dimensional tile space is defined. The positive X direction is to the right along the horizontal axis, while the positive Y direction is down along the vertical axis. Every tile has an identical signal interconnect box, and an identical set of wires that connect to the signal interconnect box. There are sets of wires that cross the tile in the Y direction (The Y channel) and sets of wires that cross the tile in the X direction (The X channel). Additionally, there are sets of wires that connect the resource inputs to the interconnect box (The I channel) and sets of wires that connect resource outputs to the interconnect box (The O channel). The last set of wires connects to a set of global signal outputs (The G channel).

Pattern Turn Definitions\n\nA channel wire set of size W has W wires in each tile. In each tile, one wire in a set will begin and one will end. If not truncated by the edge of the device each wire in the set will span W tiles. A wire has a pin in every tile it passes through, numbered 1 to W.\n\nWires do not need to have connections at every tile they span. This is commonly referred to as internal connection depopulation [1]. A wire pin may be connected to a sink or source signal from the tiles' interconnect box. The IN vector indicates the pins that have an input to the wire from the tile interconnect box. The OUT vector indicates the pins that have an output from the wire to the tile interconnect box. If the sum of all elements of the IN vector is greater than one (the wire set has more than one input) then each input driver to the wire requires a tri-state control. We assume a fully buffered interconnect. The interconnect box specification adds further detail of what resource or wire outputs can connect to other resource or wire inputs.\n\nFigure 3 shows the detail of one wire in a set where W=3 IN=101 and OUT=101. It also shows a unidirectional wire set of W=2 IN=10 and OUT=01. The input MUXs are shown with 4 inputs selected using 2 configuration bits for each MUX. The W=3 wire has more than one driver so tri- state buffers are required. For a wire set with more than one input, the default state of the input driver on the pin closest or equal to 1 is to drive the wire (At 1,1 for the W=3 example wire). The default state of all other input drivers is to be tri-stated. For a wire set to be valid a signal has to be able to travel its full length from pin 1 to pin W or pin W to pin 1." }, { "segments": [{ "left": 316.0, "top": 210.0, "width": 240.0, "height": 159.0, "page_number": 3, "page_width": 612.0, "page_height": 792.0, "text": "Figure 3 also shows a Y channel with 4 wire sets with W=2 and 4 wires sets of W=3.

There are two negative going sets of W=2 IN=10 and OUT=01, two positive going sets of W=2 IN=01 and OUT=10 and four bi-directional sets of W=3 IN=101 OUT=101. Now consider how many signals are available in a given direction. The bi-directional sets can provide 8 signals in either direction. The policy layer seeks to fix the direction before interface design time. As cores in a system will probably have the same average number interface signals in each of the two directions, it is sensible to share the bi- directional wires between positive and negative. Then the W FPGA is split into a WP FPGA of 6 and a WN FPGA of 6. As the pins on the W=3 wires are bi-directional they provide routing flexibility through dogleg opportunities. Therefore we allow only one wire in a W=3 set to be a signal carrier. This reduces the W FPGA in each direction to 4.\n\n## 4.2 The Interface Layer\n\nThe policy provides wire bandwidth to interfaces. An abstract interface definition is simply an ordered list of identified signals and their direction. Links are always point-to-point so distribution of data has to be handled within modules. A link requires two compatible mirror image interfaces. An output signal from one side implies an input to the other side and vice versa. Bi-directional interface signals are not allowed. An abstract interface is firstly declared in its original sense. It is either interpreted in its original sense or in the inverse sense depending on the direction of the signals defined in a core’s net-list. When an abstract interface is applied to one of the four directions then each signal in the interface is assigned a wire. An assigned interface is specific to a direction and defines the tile offset, wire set and wire index for every signal in the interface. An assigned interface is suitable for export to multiple core developers. An assigned interface is assumed to be in its original sense. The design tools will interpret it in accordance with the applied policy in a consistent way. For any given signal in a compatible interface, the actual wire selected on each side of a border is the same wire when the two border edges are co-located.\n\n## 4.3 Core Shape and Wire Relationship\n\nIt is important to note how wires affect the choice of a cores shape. And in turn how a core’s shape affects the availability of wires. An assigned interface has a fixed width and its wires will have a fixed depth reaching in to a core from the border. The interfaces used dictate a minimum core size." }, { "segments": [{ "left": 56.0, "top": 72.0, "width": 239.0, "height": 136.0, "page_number": 6, "page_width": 612.0, "page_height": 792.0, "text": "For example, the depth of a core along a wire channel has an effect on the wire bandwidth available.

The system is constructed from a number of identical processing elements (PE). A PE has one input interface and one output interface. They are connected up into a linear array that is terminated at either end by a host interface. A subject sequence is first loaded into the array. Then any number of sequences may be passed through. As they exit the array they will be annotated with the alignment score. This system has two abstract core tiles; the host interface (HI) and the PE.  The size of each of these cores is shown in Table 1.\n\n*\n\n```\nTable 1.  Core parameters Core Blocks Nets  Sinks PSA HI 85 63 86 PSA PE 205 221 382\n```\n\nIn order to be able to create the system from pre-routed tiles several versions of the PE are required. Each version has a different interface-edge combination. The cores required for a simple case are shown in Figure 6. With 4 PE interface-edge combinations the linear array is able to extend to the right, loop around and return to the host interface. In order to extend in more directions, more interface-edge combinations are required.\n\nThe target FPGA architecture has a wire channel composed of 16 W=2, IN=01, OUT=10 unidirectional wire sets and 16 W=3, IN=101, OUT=101 bidirectional wires sets.

We have presented a wire constraint framework that effectively utilises the full bandwidth of a device’s interconnect. This has been built into a method of creating pre-routed FPGA cores for rapid system construction. Pre-routing doesn’t affect placement flexibility directly. However, pre-routing requires that a core’s interfaces be locked to a certain edge. This reduces placement flexibility between connected cores. In order to regain lost placement flexibility we use several versions of the same function core each with a different interface-edge combination. Pre-routing small systems causes an increase in the number of wires used in connecting the system. This may result in an increase in wire delay and a reduction in system performance. The performance of a pre-routed system starts to increase over the normal and the pre- placed versions as the size of the system increases. We define rapid construction as the ability to build a system by just placing pre-routed cores without having to perform complex place and route steps. We see that being able to break a system into cores and independently optimise them accelerates the core construction process as well. The improvement in system performance and reduction in both CAD run-time and system construction time make core pre-routing an interesting avenue for further research." }, { "segments": [{ "left": 91.0, "top": 71.0, "width": 173.0, "height": 192.0, "page_number": 8, "page_width": 612.0, "page_height": 792.0, "text": "HI PE PE PE PE HI PE PE PE PE (a) (b)", "type": "Picture" }, { "left": 303.0, "top": 748.0, "width": 5.0, "height": 9.0, "page_number": 8, "page_width": 612.0, "page_height": 792.0, "text": "8", "type": "Page footer" }, { "left": 65.0, "top": 69.0, "width": 211.0, "height": 574.0, "page_number": 9, "page_width": 612.0, "page_height": 792.0, "text": "0.0E+00 5.0E+06 1.0E+07 1.5E+07 2.0E+07 2.5E+07 3.0E+07 To ta l ro ute r itera tio ns Normal 3798458 7741664 12758614 17356796 27056912 Pre-placed 3862814 7086287 10054818 13056499 16023838 Pre-routed 2499750 4787490 4787490 4787490 4787490 2 PEs 4 PEs 6 PEs 8 PEs 10 PEs (a). 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 T o tal w ir e s used Normal 1252 2415 3777 5089 6533 Pre-placed 1253 2362 3371 4422 5464 Pre-routed 1331 2397 3463 4529 5595 2 PEs 4 PEs 6 PEs 8 PEs 10 PEs (b). 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 P ath l ength (wi re hops ) Normal 27 25 31 40 41 Pre-placed 30 34 32 36 37 Pre-routed 29 33 35 35 35 2 PEs 4 PEs 6 PEs 8 PEs 10 PEs (c).", "type": "Picture" }, { "left": 55.0, "top": 656.0, "width": 230.0, "height": 33.0, "page_number": 9, "page_width": 612.0, "page_height": 792.0, "text": "Figure 8.
